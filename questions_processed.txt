	Hmm, wanna go shopping?
[83AR Reto]It's a very intense match and Reto falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Reto up and the two exchange smiles.
	That player must have a heart of gold.
[83AR Reto]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
[83AR Reto]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Reto having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?

	Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.
[83AR Reto]Reto scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!
	Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?
[83AR Reto]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Reto.
	It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.
[83AR Reto]Reto falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?
	Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.
[83AR Reto]Reto lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?
[83AR Reto]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Reto. Let's talk to her.
	Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.

	They must love volunteer work!

[83AR Reto]You find Reto lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!

	Hmm? That is odd...What do you think about this?
[83AR Reto]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!
[83AR Reto]Reto wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	What about just watching?
[83AR Reto]Reto caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	You came to see my marvelous moves? I'm flattered. 
[83AR Reto]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Reto some orders.
	Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!
[83AR Reto]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	Stop right there, pig!
[83AR Reto]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Reto seems to be worried.
	Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.
[83AR Reto]Reto came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?
[83AR Reto]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...It's about to go down...! Where's the popcorn?
[83AR Reto]Reto is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	Who could've done such a hideous thing?
[83AR Reto]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Reto seems to be sick of this.
	Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Reto!
[83AR Reto]Reto looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	How about we ask Jeunese?
[83AR Reto]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Reto to set some simple rules.

[AU96 Karpila]Ogre's pony tail slapped Karpila in the face!
	That must hurt.
[AU96 Karpila]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
[AU96 Karpila]Karpila is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.
	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[AU96 Karpila]Karpila says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[AU96 Karpila]Karpila says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[AU96 Karpila]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[AU96 Karpila]Karpila picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[AU96 Karpila]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[AU96 Karpila]Karpila is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[AU96 Karpila]Karpila thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[AU96 Karpila]Karpila seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.
	They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.
[AU96 Karpila]With a serious face, Karpila is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.
	A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?
[AU96 Karpila]Karpila came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	Just please go with that boring strategy.
[AU96 Karpila]Karpila is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.
	They're on cooldown.
[AU96 Karpila]The team is having a good run and Karpila is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	As long as we're not used as training material...
[AU96 Karpila]Karpila seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)
[AU96 Karpila]Karpila seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.
	Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.
[AU96 Karpila]Karpila is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.
	Well, having a good ace skill is a start.
[AU96 Karpila]Karpila is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.
[AU96 Karpila]Karpila plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	I'm thinking of opening a shop.
[AU96 Karpila]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Karpila and talk about what to do.
	I hope they have a ''Continue'' button around here.
[AU96 Karpila]Karpila seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.
	Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!
[AU96 Karpila]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	Cool! Awesome!
[AU96 Karpila]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	Has he gone mad?
[AU96 Karpila]Karpila's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?
	Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.
[AU96 Karpila]During a match, Karpila bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?
	Wasn't that a glitch?
[AU96 Karpila]Karpila is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.
	I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.
[AU96 Karpila]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.
[AU96 Karpila]Karpila is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.
[AU96 Karpila]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Karpila is starting to get intimidated.
	He's obviously obsessed with soccer.

[Ai]Ai is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell her?
	To win all the way, of course.
[Ai]Ai is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.
[Ai]Ai seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
	(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)
[Ai]Ai is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing any problems.
	You're right. This is a waste of time.
[Ai]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some advice.
	I don't see anything wrong as long as you can get away with it.
[Ai]Ai is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.
	Cool! Keep it up!
[Ai]Ai is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to her.
	It's silly of you to worry about such things. Are you feeling okay?
[Ai]Ai is making a scene. She'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.
	The door's over there.
[Ai]Ai is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.
	It can't be perfect every time.
[Ai]Ai is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to her?
	How about we play baseball today?
[Ai]It's before the 2nd half, and Ai is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.
	There's nothing we can really do. Let's just get this over with.
[Ai]You forgot to lock Ai and almost used her as training material! She looks very upset!
	It's your fault.
[Ai]Ai is confused that she won the MVP. What should you tell her?
	Nicely done! We're throwing a party today!
[Ai]Ai is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	Something full of excitement!
[Ai]The team is saying bad things about Ai for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
	Her love towards soccer is real.
[Ai]Ai is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	I want one of those. It'll be fun to have a pet dragon.
[Ai]Ai seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to her. 
	It'll be alright. Don't worry.
[Ai]On a day off, Ai is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
	If you find a handsome man, try talking to him!
[Ai]Ai is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I want every day to be exciting and fun.)
[Ai]There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?
	It's finally time for some festival-soccer!

[Ai]Ai is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.
	Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.
[Ai]Ai is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?
	It's the place of dreams colliding.
[Ai]Ai wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	Why don't you join them and find out?
[Ai]Ai is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.
	Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!
[Ai]Ai is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.
	Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!
[Ai]Ai is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.
	My fans!
[Ai]This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?
	Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.
[Ai]Ai says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	He'll remember someday.
[Ai]The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.
	Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!
[Ai]Ai seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.
[Ai]Ogre's pony tail slapped Ai in the face!
	That must hurt.
[Ai]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	Wow, congratulations! (Claps)

[Aiolos]Aiolos is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.
	Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.
[Aiolos]Aiolos is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?

[Aiolos]Aiolos thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[Aiolos]You find Aiolos depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.
	You did well and I thank you for that.
[Aiolos]Aiolos is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.
	That's why I need your help.
[Aiolos]You come across Aiolos being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.
	Are you feeling alright?
[Aiolos]Aiolos is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.
	I was always looking forward for that moment.
[Aiolos]Aiolos is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.
	It's just a dream. Forget about it.
[Aiolos]Aiolos is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	You can overcome this like always. Right?
[Aiolos]Aiolos seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	I'm starting to see true strength in this team.
[Aiolos]You come across Aiolos who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?
	Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.
[Aiolos]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Can't you cook ramen by yourself?
[Aiolos]You're watching the storm with Aiolos and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	What's wrong with her?
[Aiolos]Aiolos looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Littre will be fine.
[Aiolos]Aiolos's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Aiolos seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	That player is just messing with you.
[Aiolos]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Aiolos.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Aiolos]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's give them a hand.
[Aiolos]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Aiolos and her opponent isn't over yet.
	You better win that fight!
[Aiolos]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Aiolos do?
	(Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)
[Aiolos]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	They will never learn with an attitude like that.
[Aiolos]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Aiolos. What should you say?
	Well, Aiolos does have that kind of charm.
[Aiolos]Aiolos is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Can you peel this guy off of me?
[Aiolos]Latios is chatting with Aiolos after the match. Let's barge in.
	I'm looking forward to our next match!

[Aiolos]You come across Aiolos, who was overwhelmed by her opponent throughout the game. Let's cheer her up.
	I'm proud that you played your game and didn't descend to the opponent's level.
[Aiolos]Aiolos is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.
	If you're better than your teammates, you should be the one to be considerate.
[Aiolos]Aiolos, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal who you really are. What should we answer?
	Just playing soccer, that's all.
[Aiolos]Aiolos says to you that it was an honor to be able to play with you. Let's give her an answer.
	I'm starting to enjoy playing with you.
[Aiolos]You're having a conversation with Aiolos about the power of Spirit Stones which is covered in secrets. Let's tell her what you think.
	I need a Spirit Stone that's as fancy as I am.
[Aiolos]Aiolos is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''
	Let's do this! I'm at your disposal!
[Aiolos]Let's talk to Aiolos who recently started to take interest in the world of angels.
	I hope it's not a boring place.
[Aiolos]Aiolos is asking you if you ever saw the World Tree. Let's tell her your thoughts.
	Let's not talk about anything irrelevant to the match.
[Aiolos]The teammates are speaking highly of Aiolos, saying she's a good role model. Let's add in.
	She shows dominance with elegance.
[Aiolos]You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?
	I'm considering making an anonymous donation.
[Aiolos]Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Aiolos wants to say a word.
	Get yourselves together, guys. Are you going to give up already?
[Aiolos]You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.
	It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.
[Aiolos]Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?
	Pathetic. We'll show them that we're better in many ways.
[Aiolos]The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?
	A square match is what suites a proud royalty.
[Aiolos]Aiolos points out that the time the men of Minerva died and the time the epidemic broke out in Metro City matches.
	It would disgust me if that was the result of an evil plot.
[Aiolos]Mortor and Wizol of the Peacemakers are helping an old man. Aiolos seems to be surprised.
	It's good to know that they're not shallow people.
[Aiolos]A big fight broke out between an angel and a demon within the team. Aiolos is asking for help.
	I'm going to pick sides of the one I like.
[Aiolos]Cracsus threatens to hack Aiolos's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?
	[+1]Don't fall for this cheap shot.
[Aiolos]Aiolos is thinking about what Selena said about saving the galaxy if we win the Galaxy League.
	It's not good to just believe what others say.
[Aiolos]Aiolos is thinking about what the Universe of Oblivion is.
	Don't be scared about such petty things.

[Aiolos]Aiolos seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.
	Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.
[Aiolos]With a serious face, Aiolos is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.
	Being together is enough for me.
[Aiolos]Aiolos came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.
[Aiolos]Aiolos is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.
	Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?
[Aiolos]The team is having a good run and Aiolos is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	Let's keep this momentum going!
[Aiolos]Aiolos seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	Let's open up a bright future with this ball.
[Aiolos]Aiolos seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.
	Don't be weak.
[Aiolos]Aiolos is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.
	Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.
[Aiolos]Aiolos is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.
[Aiolos]Aiolos plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.
[Aiolos]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Aiolos and talk about what to do.
	We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.
[Aiolos]Aiolos seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.
	I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great. 
[Aiolos]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	...Uh...So no soccer?
[Aiolos]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!
[Aiolos]Aiolos's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?
	Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.
[Aiolos]During a match, Aiolos bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?
	It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.
[Aiolos]Aiolos is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.
	It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.
[Aiolos]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.
[Aiolos]Aiolos is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.
[Aiolos]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Aiolos is starting to get intimidated.
	Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.

[Akane]Akane is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell her?
	Best of 4 should be our goal.
[Akane]Akane is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I think that being able to understand each other is the most important.
[Akane]Akane seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
	It's within our grasp.
[Akane]Akane is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing any problems.
	The honor of our opponent is also important.
[Akane]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some advice.
	Be true to yourself.
[Akane]Akane is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.
	I'm sure you're going to become an intergalactic fool.
[Akane]Akane is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to her.
	We must have faith in the Gate Keepers and win the Galaxy League.
[Akane]Akane is making a scene. She'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.
	Are you giving up before putting up a fight?
[Akane]Akane is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.
	This needs to be analyzed and fixed. Can you help me?
[Akane]Akane is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to her?
	No, it's not boring.
[Akane]It's before the 2nd half, and Akane is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.
	Don't give up until the end.
[Akane]You forgot to lock Akane and almost used her as training material! She looks very upset!
	It's my fault.
[Akane]Akane is confused that she won the MVP. What should you tell her?
	You deserve it. Well done!
[Akane]Akane is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	I would've been doing something to save the universe.
[Akane]The team is saying bad things about Akane for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
	Do you really think that she would skip practice?
[Akane]Akane is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	I can feel the strength of that majestic creature.
[Akane]Akane seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to her. 
	Let's go look for her.
[Akane]On a day off, Akane is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
	I'd love to have a stable job first.
[Akane]Akane is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I just don't want to waste a single day in my life.)
[Akane]There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?
	Let's split up and find the uniforms.

[Akane]Akane seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.
	They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.
[Akane]With a serious face, Akane is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.
	A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?
[Akane]Akane came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	Just please go with that boring strategy.
[Akane]Akane is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.
	They're on cooldown.
[Akane]The team is having a good run and Akane is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	As long as we're not used as training material...
[Akane]Akane seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)
[Akane]Akane seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.
	Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.
[Akane]Akane is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.
	Well, having a good ace skill is a start.
[Akane]Akane is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.
[Akane]Akane plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	I'm thinking of opening a shop.
[Akane]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Akane and talk about what to do.

[Amaranth]Amaranth seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.
	They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.
[Amaranth]With a serious face, Amaranth is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.
	A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?

	Just please go with that boring strategy.
[Amaranth]Amaranth is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.
	They're on cooldown.
[Amaranth]The team is having a good run and Amaranth is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	As long as we're not used as training material...
[Amaranth]Amaranth seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)
[Amaranth]Amaranth seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.
	Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.
[Amaranth]Amaranth is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.
	Well, having a good ace skill is a start.
[Amaranth]Amaranth is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.
[Amaranth]Amaranth plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	I'm thinking of opening a shop.
[Amaranth]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Amaranth and talk about what to do.
	I hope they have a ''Continue'' button around here.
[Amaranth]Amaranth seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.
	Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!
[Amaranth]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	Cool! Awesome!
[Amaranth]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	Has he gone mad?
[Amaranth]Amaranth's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?
	Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.
[Amaranth]During a match, Amaranth bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?
	Wasn't that a glitch?
[Amaranth]Amaranth is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.
	I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.
[Amaranth]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.
[Amaranth]Amaranth is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.
[Amaranth]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Amaranth is starting to get intimidated.
	He's obviously obsessed with soccer.

[Ami]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Ami asks how you feel. How should we answer?

	How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.
[Ami]Ami is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.
	(Pat her on the head.)
[Ami]Ami has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.
	I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.
[Ami]As Ami said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.
	I'm sure it's going in a good direction.
[Ami]The crowd is cheering for Ami. Ami seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.
	They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.
[Ami]Ami is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.
	I am so thankful to them.
[Ami]Ami was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.
	Oh, that'll be so cute!
[Ami]The team will not have a match for some time. Ami asks you about your plan.
	Hmm, wanna go shopping?
[Ami]It's a very intense match and Ami falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Ami up and the two exchange smiles.
	That player must have a heart of gold.
[Ami]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
[Ami]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Ami having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?
[Ami]Ami is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.
	Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.
[Ami]Ami scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!
	Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?
[Ami]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Ami.
	It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.
[Ami]Ami falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?
	Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.
[Ami]Ami lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?
[Ami]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Ami. Let's talk to her.
	Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.
[Ami]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Ami is curious and wants to take a look.
	They must love volunteer work!
[Ami]Ami brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.

[Ami]You find Ami depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.
	You did well and I thank you for that.
[Ami]Ami is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.

[Ami]Ami is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.
	It's just a dream. Forget about it.
[Ami]Ami is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	You can overcome this like always. Right?
[Ami]Ami seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	I'm starting to see true strength in this team.
[Ami]You come across Ami who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?
	Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.
[Ami]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Can't you cook ramen by yourself?
[Ami]You're watching the storm with Ami and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	What's wrong with her?
[Ami]Ami looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Littre will be fine.
[Ami]Ami's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Ami seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	That player is just messing with you.
[Ami]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Ami.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Ami]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's give them a hand.
[Ami]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Ami and her opponent isn't over yet.
	You better win that fight!
[Ami]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Ami do?
	(Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)
[Ami]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	They will never learn with an attitude like that.
[Ami]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Ami. What should you say?
	Well, Ami does have that kind of charm.
[Ami]Ami is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Can you peel this guy off of me?

	I'm looking forward to our next match!

[Anael]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Anael asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	What, are you expecting something like ''I feel like I can fly'' or something?
[Anael]Anael suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.
[Anael]Anael is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.
	(Just nod your head.)
[Anael]Anael has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.
	You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.
[Anael]As Anael said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.
	I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.
[Anael]The crowd is cheering for Anael. Anael seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.
	How about just accepting the compliments for today?
[Anael]Anael is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.
	The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.
[Anael]Anael was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.
	It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!
[Anael]The team will not have a match for some time. Anael asks you about your plan.
	I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.
[Anael]It's a very intense match and Anael falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Anael up and the two exchange smiles.
	Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?
[Anael]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.
[Anael]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Anael having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	...I see two idiots standing in front of me...
[Anael]Anael is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.
	I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.
[Anael]Anael scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!
	That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!
[Anael]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Anael.
	He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.
[Anael]Anael falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?
	If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.
[Anael]Anael lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...
[Anael]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Anael. Let's talk to her.
	(Ignore.)
[Anael]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Anael is curious and wants to take a look.
	We should probably ignore them and just walk by.
[Anael]Anael brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	Throw it away. NOW.

	I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.
[Anael]Anael asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give her a sincere answer.
	I guess I'll be chasing you on the road of glory.
[Anael]Anael is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.
	I think they're cute and elegant if you leave out the pig and bear. 
[Anael]Anael looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?
	The space has prepared this beautiful stage for you.
[Anael]Anael says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.
	They're young but they have passion.
[Anael]Anael wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.
	Thankful beings that will be our +160.
[Anael]Anael is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.
	How about we make it to the top of the Galaxy League and shine the universe with the light within us?
[Anael]Anael says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	Tell them they should remember that they play for you.
[Anael]Anael says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	Did she think that you'll take over the throne?
[Anael]Anael seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?
	Good for you! I know it's hard for you to find someone at your level!
[Anael]Anael is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?
	I don't think you need to worry about a diet.
[Anael]Anael says she's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.
	Ask her if she likes you and if she wants to join our team.
[Anael]Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Anael seems to be troubled. What should we do?
	You both need to be disciplined by Anael.
[Anael]Anael is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	You seem like the princess...Scratch that, the queen.
[Anael]Anael went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	I feel sorry for the other team.
[Anael]Anael claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	I don't care what the case is.
[Anael]Anael seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	Be careful not to be stomped on...
[Anael]Anael says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	That's strange. I thought he was more of an authoritative character.
[Anael]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Anael hands you a present.
	(A chocker with a pretty radical design.)
[Anael]Anael says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.
	That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy, and love.

[Ari]With a serious look on her face, Ari warns you to go to the bathroom before the match.

	Makes it worth the challenge, don't you think so?

[Aslan]Aslan is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	It's surprising to see such advanced technology.
[Aslan]Aslan plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	We'll see about it after the League.
[Aslan]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Aslan and talk about what to do.
	Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.
[Aslan]Aslan seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.
	I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.
[Aslan]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!
[Aslan]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	I guess he's happy this is a good match.
[Aslan]Aslan's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?
	If you keep it up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.
[Aslan]During a match, Aslan bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?
	We have to keep on going.
[Aslan]Aslan is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.
	Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.
[Aslan]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.
[Aslan]Aslan is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.
[Aslan]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Aslan is starting to get intimidated.
	This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.

[Avnore]Avnore is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.
	The opponents are mesmerized by the beauty of our players.
[Avnore]After a meeting, Avnore's eyes met yours a several times and Avnore asks if he has something on his face.
	Yeah, Kuma's hat...
[Avnore]With a serious look on his face, Avnore warns you to go to the bathroom before the match.
	Why does an ordinary advice sound so strange...
[Avnore]Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Avnore on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?
	I think it should be you, but will you be able to return to your normal life after all of this is...Wait, I'm going off topic, right?
[Avnore]Avnore is worried that he has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous things. What should we tell him?
	Look at the beautiful players! This is paradise!
[Avnore]Avnore is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to him.
	...If you want to say something, it's alright. I'll be listening.
[Avnore]Avnore is asking if you have a special person who you would like to share happy moments with. Let's give him an answer.
	My Nari dakimakura! She's the best idol in the universe and is super strong.
[Avnore]You find Avnore being very excited after performing an awesome play. How will you react?
	Can't you do that more often?! (Cries)
[Avnore]Avnore is having trouble focusing on the match. Let's help him out.
	It's impossible to focus on a field with so many beautiful women.
[Avnore]Avnore is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.
	That bear...Is a hero...!
[Avnore]Avnore doesn't like the new team advertisement video.
	There's not enough fan service.
[Avnore]It's Avnore's birthday. Let's give him a present.
	I stole this treasure box from Kuma.
[Avnore]You see Avnore's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Avnore. What should we do?
	Tell me if you like him. Just say the words and I'll scout him.
[Avnore]The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?
	Manga, anime, and figures...! Here I come!
[Avnore]You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also Avnore's rival, has been severely injured and is in the hospital. What should you say to him?
	This is our chance to steal his precious collection.
[Avnore]Avnore comes to you and says that he has to leave the team because of personal reasons. What should we say?
	So, how does this work? Do I tap ''Sell''?
[Avnore]Avnore is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with Avnore.
	I think we should come up with an action speed deck or go for counterattacks...
[Avnore]Avnore is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.
	So, is that king entering the Galaxy League?
[Avnore]You got a couple of tickets to Veronica's live concert. Avnore seems to be interested.
	I'll give you this, so get rid of that fake ticket.
[Avnore]Avnore says he wants to cry because the goal keeper on the other team just won't go down no matter how many shots he makes.
	Let's start by picking their defenses apart.

[Avnore]Avnore is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	They were a worthy opponent.
[Avnore]This was the worst game in your entire life...Avnore comes to you to cheer you up.
	Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.
[Avnore]You're talking to Avnore about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow. Let's tell him your answer.
	I would say goodbye to all my friends.
[Avnore]Avnore is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to him.
	I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
[Avnore]Avnore is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give him some advice.
	Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
[Avnore]Avnore isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. He feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
	Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.
[Avnore]With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Avnore for solutions.
	I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
[Avnore]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.
[Avnore]You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Avnore and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest. 
	Let's give her some space.
[Avnore]Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
	This proves that even the aliens like Nari.
[Avnore]According to Avnore's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
	I thought they were just friends.
[Avnore]Avnore thinks he knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
	First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal. 
[Avnore]Avnore won a trip around the world from a radio event!
	Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.
[Avnore]Avnore suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.
	That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.
[Avnore]The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.
	Let's see what you have to say after the match.
[Avnore]You're sick and in bed when Avnore and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?
	I'm sorry...I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...
[Avnore]The match and the concert that Avnore was looking for start at the same time...
	I'm sorry that you couldn't go.
[Avnore]Avnore wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
	Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.
[Avnore]MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
	Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?
[Avnore]The match started and Avnore is standing still doing nothing.
	Looks like we'll have to do without him.

[Azrael]Azrael is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell her?
	Teamwork is what matters the most.
[Azrael]Azrael is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I have very specific standards for personality, looks, values, and background. Are you interested in hearing about it?
[Azrael]Azrael seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
	I would like to hear what you think is the best team in the universe.
[Azrael]Azrael is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing any problems.
	That team is far from your style.
[Azrael]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some advice.
	Is winning really worth going that far?
[Azrael]Azrael is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.
	I..Respect your naming taste...
[Azrael]Azrael is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to her.
	A mysterious villain...Bad taste, if you ask me.
[Azrael]Azrael is making a scene. She'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.
	Vicious? More like ugly.
[Azrael]Azrael is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.
	Passes that you prefer aren't always the right answer.
[Azrael]Azrael is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to her?
	If you're up for suggestions, I'm all ears.
[Azrael]It's before the 2nd half, and Azrael is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.
	We should at least put up a fight so they remember us.
[Azrael]You forgot to lock Azrael and almost used her as training material! She looks very upset!
	It was all just to motivate you to become a better player!
[Azrael]Azrael is confused that she won the MVP. What should you tell her?
	Aren't you satisfied with your performance?
[Azrael]Azrael is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	I would've tried to find something that fits me.
[Azrael]The team is saying bad things about Azrael for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
	Skipping practice isn't something that's in her dictionary.
[Azrael]Azrael is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	Hmm...If only I could change the shape of the horns and the color of the scales. That'd be perfect.
[Azrael]Azrael seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to her. 
	Everybody should grow up.
[Azrael]On a day off, Azrael is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
	It's really hard to find the right person.
[Azrael]Azrael is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I want my dreams to come true.)
[Azrael]There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?
	What's done is done. Let's come up with a new design.

[Azrael]Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Azrael is asking how she did in the match.
	You were picking the other team apart! It was awesome!
[Azrael]Azrael looks excited as she's talking with the team about pets. She turns around and asks you what kind of pet you like.
	I like puppies. The loyal ones!
[Azrael]You come across Azrael thinking about the value of soccer. What should we tell her?
	I feel something when I overpower my opponents on the field.
[Azrael]Azrael is having trouble focusing on the match because of the affectionate emotion she feels. She says she must leave now to propose to her lover. What should we say?
	You don't need to be the one being dragged around.
[Azrael]Azrael blushes up and tells you that she's happy she can play soccer with you. What should we tell her?
	*Smiles bitterly*
[Azrael]Azrael is asking for special training sessions because she's not satisfied with today's performance. What should we tell her?
	Sure. Let's get on to it.
[Azrael]Azrael did her best, but she failed to achieve the results she wanted and looks sad. We should say something to her.
	Sorry, I feel that this is on me.
[Azrael]Azrael is asking you about what you like besides soccer.
	Rugby, a sport of strength!
[Azrael]Azrael feels her heart races when she sees Littre.
	...That's not a rabbit.
[Azrael]Kuma is caught sneaking in the woman's locker room once again. We should talk with Azrael about what to do with him.
	Let's make him put on Ogre's underwear.
[Azrael]Azrael continues to charge into the opponent's defense line and keeps failing. What should we do?
	(Guide her by kicking the ball toward the weak link in the opponent's defense.)
[Azrael]Azrael is being annoying with her offensive words. What should we do?
	(Ignore it.)
[Azrael]It's dinner time and Azrael is staring at her carrot soup with a troubled look. What should we do?
	(Eat it instead of her.)
[Azrael]It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking up for the morning training. What should we tell Azrael to do?
	Wake them up. Kick them if you need to.
[Azrael]Azrael says that the soup tastes funny. What should we do?
	We shouldn't throw away food. Let's give it to somebody else.
[Azrael]Azrael is furious about the referee that's clearly favoring the other team. Should we stop her?
	(Step on the referee's foot and pretend it was an accident.)
[Azrael]It suddenly began to rain heavily. You see Azrael running up ahead.
	(Let her steal your umbrella.)
[Azrael]You witnessed a player on the other side putting a tack in Azrael's shoe.
	(Tell Azrael who did this.)
[Azrael]During the team meeting, you find a player sleeping. What should you do?
	(Leave it to Azrael.)
[Azrael]Azrael hurt her leg during the 1st half of the match, but she insists on playing. What should we tell her?
	Okay. You make them pay, understand?

[Baltheon]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Baltheon asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	What, are you expecting something like ''I feel like I'm in heaven'' or something?
[Baltheon]Baltheon suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.
[Baltheon]Baltheon is saying that his teammates are what keeps him going.
	(Just nod your head.)
[Baltheon]Baltheon has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. He is asking for your evaluation on his plays. Let's give him an answer.
	You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.
[Baltheon]As Baltheon said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to him.
	I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.
[Baltheon]The crowd is cheering for Baltheon. Baltheon seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help him out.
	How about just accepting the compliments for today?
[Baltheon]Baltheon is impressed by the help he received from the elementals. Let's talk to him.
	The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.
[Baltheon]Baltheon was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin himself. Let's talk to him.
	It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!
[Baltheon]The team will not have a match for some time. Baltheon asks you about your plan.
	I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.
[Baltheon]It's a very intense match and Baltheon falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Baltheon up and the two exchange smiles.
	Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?
[Baltheon]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.
[Baltheon]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Baltheon having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	...I see two idiots standing in front of me...
[Baltheon]Baltheon is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to him.
	I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.
[Baltheon]Baltheon scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate him!
	That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!
[Baltheon]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Baltheon.
	He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.
[Baltheon]Baltheon falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to him?
	If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.
[Baltheon]Baltheon lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...
[Baltheon]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Baltheon. Let's talk to her.
	(Ignore.)
[Baltheon]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Baltheon is curious and wants to take a look.
	We should probably ignore them and just walk by.
[Baltheon]Baltheon brought a drink that he says he received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	Throw it away. NOW.

[Baltheon]Baltheon is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	The other team went home crying!
[Baltheon]This was the worst game in your entire life...Baltheon comes to you to cheer you up.
	Thanks...I know you're the one that's the most devastated...Let's do better next time.
[Baltheon]You're talking to Baltheon about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow. Let's tell him your answer.
	Hmm, there's a guy I'd like to beat up before I die.
[Baltheon]Baltheon is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to him.
	It's only a sport! The strongest team wins, and we are strong!
[Baltheon]Baltheon is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give him some advice.
	Make the scouters fall in love with your performance!
[Baltheon]Baltheon isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. He feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
	We may have to go rough on the team and make them realize the problem.
[Baltheon]With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Baltheon for solutions.
	We won't be able to win the league if we fail to overcome this. 
[Baltheon]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	We're going to hunt that manager down and take back our money. We will show no mercy!
[Baltheon]You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Baltheon and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest. 
	There's no time for tears! Find out who did this and bring justice!
[Baltheon]Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
	The stage is so majestic! It's awesome!
[Baltheon]According to Baltheon's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
	William doesn't know how to respect his seniors.
[Baltheon]Baltheon thinks he knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
	...Sometimes, the truth is better to be left a secret.
[Baltheon]Baltheon won a trip around the world from a radio event!
	What about soccer? You'll have to go through me to go on that trip!
[Baltheon]Baltheon suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.
	This is a good chance to show the baby angels how rough soccer can be!
[Baltheon]The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.
	Care to receive the ball with your face?
[Baltheon]You're sick and in bed when Baltheon and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?
	You guys...I'm about to cry...
[Baltheon]The match and the concert that Baltheon was looking for start at the same time...
	Channel that sorrow and rage towards your opponents and make them pay.
[Baltheon]Baltheon wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
	Maybe he just wants to duke it out.
[Baltheon]MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
	Stop right there!
[Baltheon]The match started and Baltheon is standing still doing nothing.
	Run! Just start running!

[Baltheon]Baltheon is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give him an answer.
	We need a decent level of personal performance.
[Baltheon]Baltheon, who is determined to make everything in his life, even his dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've never dreamt about soccer.
[Baltheon]Baltheon announces that he will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give him an answer.
	I have faith in you.
[Baltheon]Baltheon is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to him?
	That doesn't change what we must do.
[Baltheon]Baltheon wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. He wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to him.
	Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
[Baltheon]It seems that Baltheon is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Baltheon? Nah, he never gets lost.
[Baltheon]You find Baltheon lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[Baltheon]Baltheon says he doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. He thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
[Baltheon]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[Baltheon]Baltheon wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
[Baltheon]Baltheon caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[Baltheon]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Baltheon some orders.
	Let's try out some forward passes.
[Baltheon]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	It's time we use him as training material.
[Baltheon]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Baltheon seems to be worried.
	It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.
[Baltheon]Baltheon came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I hope that wasn't all you got.
[Baltheon]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...We should get out of here.
[Baltheon]Baltheon is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer him up?
	It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
[Baltheon]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Baltheon seems to be sick of this.
	Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
[Baltheon]Baltheon looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	It's space. Anything can exist here.
[Baltheon]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Baltheon to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

[Baltheon]Baltheon seems to be lost after having a good match while his fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to him.
	It's just a myth. Forget about it.
[Baltheon]With a serious face, Baltheon is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give him an answer.
	Well, I'm sure we'll get an answer when we get to the end of this.
[Baltheon]Baltheon came to you after the match, and says he's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	Let's work up a solution.
[Baltheon]Baltheon is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.
	They support us from the shadows.
[Baltheon]The team is having a good run and Baltheon is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.
[Baltheon]Baltheon seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.
[Baltheon]Baltheon seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.
	Maybe if you increase your Strength...
[Baltheon]Baltheon is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.
	Flawless skills.
[Baltheon]Baltheon is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	It's surprising to see such advanced technology.
[Baltheon]Baltheon plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.
	We'll see about it after the League.
[Baltheon]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Baltheon and talk about what to do.
	Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.
[Baltheon]Baltheon seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.
	I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.
[Baltheon]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!
[Baltheon]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	I guess he's happy this is a good match.
[Baltheon]Baltheon's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next match. What should we say to him?
	If you keep it up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.
[Baltheon]During a match, Baltheon bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?
	We have to keep on going.
[Baltheon]Baltheon is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to him.
	Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.
[Baltheon]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.
[Baltheon]Baltheon is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.
[Baltheon]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Baltheon is starting to get intimidated.
	This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.

[Banesia]Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Banesia is asking how she did in the match.
	You bring the best out of the team. Good work!
[Banesia]Banesia looks excited as she's talking with the team about pets. She turns around and asks you what kind of pet you like.
	I think that a baby duck following its mother is one of the most adorable things to watch.
[Banesia]You come across Banesia thinking about the value of soccer. What should we tell her?
	The field is a ground of hopes and dreams. Isn't that enough?
[Banesia]Banesia is having trouble focusing on the match because of the affectionate emotion she feels. She says she must leave now to propose to her lover. What should we say?
	Think about your teammates that are counting on you.
[Banesia]Banesia blushes up and tells you that she's happy she can play soccer with you. What should we tell her?
	Me too. You're a good leader.
[Banesia]Banesia is asking for special training sessions because she's not satisfied with today's performance. What should we tell her?
	If that's your wish.
[Banesia]Banesia did her best, but she failed to achieve the results she wanted and looks sad. We should say something to her.
	It's experiences like this that bonds us together.
[Banesia]Banesia is asking you about what you like besides soccer.
	I like board games about war. I admire famous commanders.

	Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.
[Black Tortoise]Black Tortoise is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.
[Black Tortoise]Black Tortoise plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.
[Black Tortoise]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Black Tortoise and talk about what to do.
	We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.
[Black Tortoise]Black Tortoise seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.
	I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great. 
[Black Tortoise]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	...Uh...So no soccer?
[Black Tortoise]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!
[Black Tortoise]Black Tortoise's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?
	Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.
[Black Tortoise]During a match, Black Tortoise bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?
	It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.
[Black Tortoise]Black Tortoise is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.
	It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.

	I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.
[Black Tortoise]Black Tortoise is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.
[Black Tortoise]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Black Tortoise is starting to get intimidated.
	Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.

	I've never dreamt about soccer.
[Blade]Blade announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	I have faith in you.

	That doesn't change what we must do.
[Blade]Blade wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
	Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
[Blade]It seems that Blade is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Blade? Nah, she never gets lost.
[Blade]You find Blade lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[Blade]Blade says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
[Blade]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[Blade]Blade wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
[Blade]Blade caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[Blade]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Blade some orders.
	Let's try out some forward passes.
[Blade]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	It's time we use him as training material.
[Blade]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Blade seems to be worried.
	It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.
[Blade]Blade came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I hope that wasn't all you got.
[Blade]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...We should get out of here.
[Blade]Blade is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
[Blade]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Blade seems to be sick of this.
	Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
[Blade]Blade looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	It's space. Anything can exist here.
[Blade]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Blade to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

[Blade]Blade seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.
	Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.
[Blade]With a serious face, Blade is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.
	Being together is enough for me.
[Blade]Blade came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.
[Blade]Blade is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.
	Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?
[Blade]The team is having a good run and Blade is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	Let's keep this momentum going!
[Blade]Blade seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.

	What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?
[Blue Dragon]Blue Dragon, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.

	I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!
[Blue Dragon]Blue Dragon wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	What about just watching?
[Blue Dragon]Blue Dragon caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	You came to see my marvelous moves? I'm flattered. 
[Blue Dragon]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Blue Dragon some orders.
	Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!
[Blue Dragon]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	Stop right there, pig!
[Blue Dragon]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Blue Dragon seems to be worried.

	What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?
[Blue Dragon]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...It's about to go down...! Where's the popcorn?
[Blue Dragon]Blue Dragon is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	Who could've done such a hideous thing?

[Blue Dragon]Blue Dragon looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	How about we ask Jeunese?

	I'm proud that you played your game and didn't descend to the opponent's level.
[Blue Dragon]Blue Dragon is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.
	If you're better than your teammates, you should be the one to be considerate.
[Blue Dragon]Blue Dragon, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal who you really are. What should we answer?
	Just playing soccer, that's all.
[Blue Dragon]Blue Dragon says to you that it was an honor to be able to play with you. Let's give her an answer.
	I'm starting to enjoy playing with you.
[Blue Dragon]You're having a conversation with Blue Dragon about the power of Spirit Stones which is covered in secrets. Let's tell her what you think.

	I hope it's not a boring place.
[Blue Dragon]Blue Dragon is asking you if you ever saw the World Tree. Let's tell her your thoughts.

	She shows dominance with elegance.
[Blue Dragon]You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?
	I'm considering making an anonymous donation.
[Blue Dragon]Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Blue Dragon wants to say a word.
	Get yourselves together, guys. Are you going to give up already?
[Blue Dragon]You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.
	It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.
[Blue Dragon]Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?
	Pathetic. We'll show them that we're better in many ways.
[Blue Dragon]The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?
	A square match is what suites a proud royalty.
[Blue Dragon]Blue Dragon points out that the time the men of Minerva died and the time the epidemic broke out in Metro City matches.
	It would disgust me if that was the result of an evil plot.

[Bora]Bora seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.
	Don't be weak.
[Bora]Bora is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.
	Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.
[Bora]Bora is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.
[Bora]Bora plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.
[Bora]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Bora and talk about what to do.
	We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.
[Bora]Bora seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.
	I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great. 
[Bora]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	...Uh...So no soccer?
[Bora]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?

	I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.
[Bora]Bora is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.
[Bora]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Bora is starting to get intimidated.
	Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.

[Brett]Brett is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell him?
	Best of 4 should be our goal.
[Brett]Brett is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I think that being able to understand each other is the most important.
[Brett]Brett seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. He seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
	It's within our grasp.
[Brett]Brett is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop him from causing any problems.
	The honor of our opponent is also important.

[Brett]Brett is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to him.

	This needs to be analyzed and fixed. Can you help me?

	No, it's not boring.
[Brett]It's before the 2nd half, and Brett is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.
	Don't give up until the end.

	We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.
[Brett]It's a very intense match and Brett falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Brett up and the two exchange smiles.
	True sportsmanship! Wonderful!
[Brett]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.

	Let's do our best until the very end!
[Cassiel]You're having a conversation with Cassiel about the power of Spirit Stones which is covered in secrets. Let's tell him what you think.

[Cassiel]Cassiel is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''
	I like what you just said.
[Cassiel]Let's talk to Cassiel who recently started to take interest in the world of angels.
	It's a place to rest for the good.

	It's something I'd want to see again with a person I care.

	He's truly a role model to us all with his skills and attitude.
[Cassiel]You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?
	I feel sorry, but that's irrelevant to the match.
[Cassiel]Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Cassiel wants to say a word.
	Come on guys, you know it's an exciting thing to be playing against a strong team! Keep your heads up high!
[Cassiel]You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.
	So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.

	We will confront them fair and square, and win.
[Cassiel]The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?
	Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?
[Cassiel]Cassiel points out that the time the men of Minerva died and the time the epidemic broke out in Metro City matches.
	That's too convenient to be a coincidence.
[Cassiel]Mortor and Wizol of the Peacemakers are helping an old man. Cassiel seems to be surprised.

	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...

[Cecily]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Cecily]Cecily is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.

	Littre will be fine.
[Celine]Celine's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Celine seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	That player is just messing with you.
[Celine]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Celine.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Celine]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.

[Celine]Celine asks what you think is the most important ability in soccer. Give her an answer.
	Excitement and elegance. The fans love it.
[Celine]Celine is criticizing the male teammates that were mesmerized by Lilith during the match. It's your job to defend your teammates.
	I think they're also mesmerized by you. You have a charm that matches a demon...
[Celine]Being too excited, Celine is overreacting while talking about the game. It seems she wants people to agree with her.
	Yeah. The sight of you running on the field was marvelous.
[Celine]Celine is asking what it would be like to date an alien. Give her your opinion.

	(Meet up with my lover.)
[Celine]Celine heard stories about the world of the demons and asks what you think it'll be like.
	It'll sure be dangerous, but I think it'll be a place full of thrills and wonders.
[Celine]Celine, who seems to be interested in Eve, is asking your opinion about her. What should we tell her?

[Celine]Celine's uniform is all messed up because of the filthy plays of her opponent. What should we do?
	(It won't be long until the opponent becomes mesmerized by Celine's charms.)

	It's time for some good food.

	Even his hair is a weapon! Is that even allowed?
[Celus]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?

	I knew this day would come.
[Celus]Celus says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.
[Celus]Celus says he forgot to use his skill points before entering the match. What should we say to him?

	It's time, Celus! Awaken the 6th attribute and show your true powers!
[Celus]Celus thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.

	Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.
[Chiffon]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.
[Chiffon]Chiffon is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.

	Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes, will you?
[Chitose]Chitose is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.
	I'll sleep by your side tonight.
[Chitose]Chitose is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.
[Chitose]Chitose seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	Perfect! No mistakes made!
[Chitose]You come across Chitose who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?

[Chitose]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.
[Chitose]You're watching the storm with Chitose and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.

[Chitose]Chitose looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.

	Don't come over here! It's dangerous!
[Chitose]Latios is chatting with Chitose after the match. Let's barge in.
	Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's our pretty girl.

[Chitose]Chitose is asking you what you think is it that makes this team great. You weren't expecting this, but you should give her an answer.
	You. I know you're doing much for the team without taking any credit.
[Chitose]Chitose is angry because she was criticized by her performance and is asking your opinion. Let's give her an answer.
	I want to practice with you, if that's okay with you. No?
[Chitose]Chitose, who has shown absolutely superb chemistry with you, is embarrassed and says she didn't do all of that because of you. What should we say?
	Yeah? Well, I did what I did for you.
[Chitose]Chitose wants to have an academic conversation about the 5th dimension, string theory, and other infamously hard space theories. Why...?

	Be honest and show a sincere attitude.

	Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.

[Ciel]MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
	Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?
[Ciel]The match started and Ciel is standing still doing nothing.
	Looks like we'll have to do without her.

[Ciel]Ciel says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?
	Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.

	It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.

[Cyril]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Cyril asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!
[Cyril]Cyril suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!
[Cyril]Cyril is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.
	(Put your thumbs up, wink, and send a juicy smile.)
[Cyril]Cyril has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.
	Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it. You should keep that going.
[Cyril]As Cyril said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.
	It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.
[Cyril]The crowd is cheering for Cyril. Cyril seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.
	They're all in love with your enthusiastic play.
[Cyril]Cyril is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.
	I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!
[Cyril]Cyril was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.
	We can play soccer with the penguins!
[Cyril]The team will not have a match for some time. Cyril asks you about your plan.
	We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.
[Cyril]It's a very intense match and Cyril falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Cyril up and the two exchange smiles.
	True sportsmanship! Wonderful!
[Cyril]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.
[Cyril]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Cyril having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	Save the energy for the match.
[Cyril]Cyril is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.
	The fans love your performance!
[Cyril]Cyril scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!
	You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!
[Cyril]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Cyril.
	I feel like he's mocking us!
[Cyril]Cyril falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?
	Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!
[Cyril]Cyril lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	I will avenge you!
[Cyril]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Cyril. Let's talk to her.
	We'll win next time!
[Cyril]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Cyril is curious and wants to take a look.
	Let's go help them!
[Cyril]Cyril brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	Drink it up!

[Czerny]Czerny is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.
	Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.
[Czerny]Czerny is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?
	It's the place of dreams colliding.
[Czerny]Czerny wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	Why don't you join them and find out?
[Czerny]Czerny is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.
	Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!
[Czerny]Czerny is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.
	Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!
[Czerny]Czerny is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.
	My fans!
[Czerny]This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?
	Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.
[Czerny]Czerny says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	He'll remember someday.
[Czerny]The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.
	Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!
[Czerny]Czerny seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.
[Czerny]Ogre's pony tail slapped Czerny in the face!
	That must hurt.
[Czerny]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
[Czerny]Czerny is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.
	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[Czerny]Czerny says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[Czerny]Czerny says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[Czerny]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Czerny]Czerny picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[Czerny]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Czerny]Czerny is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[Czerny]Czerny thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[Czerny]You find Czerny depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.
	You did well and I thank you for that.
[Czerny]Czerny is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.
	That's why I need your help.
[Czerny]You come across Czerny being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.
	Are you feeling alright?
[Czerny]Czerny is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.
	I was always looking forward for that moment.
[Czerny]Czerny is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.
	It's just a dream. Forget about it.
[Czerny]Czerny is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	You can overcome this like always. Right?
[Czerny]Czerny seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	I'm starting to see true strength in this team.
[Czerny]You come across Czerny who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?
	Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.
[Czerny]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Can't you cook ramen by yourself?
[Czerny]You're watching the storm with Czerny and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	What's wrong with her?
[Czerny]Czerny looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Littre will be fine.
[Czerny]Czerny's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Czerny seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	That player is just messing with you.
[Czerny]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Czerny.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Czerny]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's give them a hand.
[Czerny]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Czerny and her opponent isn't over yet.
	You better win that fight!
[Czerny]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Czerny do?
	(Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)
[Czerny]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	They will never learn with an attitude like that.
[Czerny]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Czerny. What should you say?
	Well, Czerny does have that kind of charm.
[Czerny]Czerny is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Can you peel this guy off of me?
[Czerny]Latios is chatting with Czerny after the match. Let's barge in.
	I'm looking forward to our next match!

[DU007 Nute]Nute is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell her?
	To win all the way, of course.
[DU007 Nute]Nute is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.
[DU007 Nute]Nute seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
	(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)

	How about we play baseball today?
[DU007 Nute]It's before the 2nd half, and Nute is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.

	I want one of those. It'll be fun to have a pet dragon.

	It'll be alright. Don't worry.

	If you find a handsome man, try talking to him!
[DU007 Nute]Nute is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I want every day to be exciting and fun.)

	It's finally time for some festival-soccer!

[DU007 Nute]Nute says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?
	Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.

	I'm going to make a joke before I start crying!
[DU007 Nute]Nute is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.
	Do you think they'll be tasty?
[DU007 Nute]Nute looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?
	Do you think any of those comets are populated?
[DU007 Nute]Nute says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.
	Teach them how adults play soccer.
[DU007 Nute]Nute wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.
	Beginner level monsters in an RPG game.
[DU007 Nute]Nute is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.
	That's deep. I think it's cool.
[DU007 Nute]Nute says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.
[DU007 Nute]Nute says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry.
[DU007 Nute]Nute seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?
	Don't forget that we exist! Haha!
[DU007 Nute]Nute is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?
	Please don't forget about the match.
[DU007 Nute]Nute says she's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.
	Is her name really Kiki?
[DU007 Nute]Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Nute seems to be troubled. What should we do?
	If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?
[DU007 Nute]Nute is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.
[DU007 Nute]Nute went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	We should think about how to make fun of her when she comes back.
[DU007 Nute]Nute claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	Maybe Sophie is actually a male...?
[DU007 Nute]Nute seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?
[DU007 Nute]Nute says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.
[DU007 Nute]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Nute hands you a present.
	(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)
[DU007 Nute]Nute says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.
	Maybe she's up to something.

[Dale]Dale is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell him?
	Teamwork is what matters the most.
[Dale]Dale is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I have very specific standards for personality, looks, values, and background. Are you interested in hearing about it?

	I would like to hear what you think is the best team in the universe.

	That team is far from your style.
[Dale]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give him some advice.
	Is winning really worth going that far?
[Dale]Dale is having trouble deciding a name for his special move. His options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.
	I..Respect your naming taste...
[Dale]Dale is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to him.
	A mysterious villain...Bad taste, if you ask me.
[Dale]Dale is making a scene. He'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.
	Vicious? More like ugly.
[Dale]Dale is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.
	Passes that you prefer aren't always the right answer.
[Dale]Dale is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to him?
	If you're up for suggestions, I'm all ears.
[Dale]It's before the 2nd half, and Dale is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.

	Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
[Damien]Damien isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. He feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
	Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.

	I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
[Damien]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.
[Damien]You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Damien and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.

[Damien]The match and the concert that Damien was looking for start at the same time...
	I'm sorry that you couldn't go.
[Damien]Damien wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.

	Hmm, wanna go shopping?
[Danbi]It's a very intense match and Danbi falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Danbi up and the two exchange smiles.
	That player must have a heart of gold.
[Danbi]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
[Danbi]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Danbi having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?

	This doesn't look good...Can anybody give him some heals?
[Danbi]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Danbi. Let's talk to her.

[Danbi]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Danbi is curious and wants to take a look.
	They must love volunteer work!

[Danbi]Danbi seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.
[Danbi]Ogre's pony tail slapped Danbi in the face!
	That must hurt.
[Danbi]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
[Danbi]Danbi is suddenly showing massive improvement in his performance. He must've learned something during a match.
	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[Danbi]Danbi says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[Danbi]Danbi says he forgot to use his skill points before entering the match. What should we say to him?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[Danbi]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Danbi]Danbi picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[Danbi]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Danbi]Danbi is irritated because his opponent has the attribute advantage over him.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.

[Dochi]Dochi seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. He seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?

	Be true to yourself.
[Dochi]Dochi is having trouble deciding a name for his special move. His options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.
	I'm sure you're going to become an intergalactic fool.
[Dochi]Dochi is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to him.

	I'd love to have a stable job first.
[Dochi]Dochi is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I just don't want to waste a single day in my life.)

	Let's split up and find the uniforms.

[Dochi]The team is having a good run and Dochi is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.
[Dochi]Dochi seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.

[Dochi]Dochi seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.
	Maybe if you increase your Strength...
[Dochi]Dochi is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.

[Dochi]Dochi plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.
	We'll see about it after the League.

	Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.
[Dochi]Dochi seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.
	I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.
[Dochi]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!

	I guess he's happy this is a good match.

	Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.
[Dochi]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.
[Dochi]Dochi is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.
[Dochi]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Dochi is starting to get intimidated.
	This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.

[EA00 Rammi]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Rammi seems to be worried.
	It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.
[EA00 Rammi]Rammi came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I hope that wasn't all you got.
[EA00 Rammi]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...We should get out of here.
[EA00 Rammi]Rammi is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
[EA00 Rammi]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Rammi seems to be sick of this.
	Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
[EA00 Rammi]Rammi looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	It's space. Anything can exist here.
[EA00 Rammi]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Rammi to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

[EA00 Rammi]You come across Rammi, who was overwhelmed by her opponent throughout the game. Let's cheer her up.
	I'm proud that you played your game and didn't descend to the opponent's level.
[EA00 Rammi]Rammi is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.
	If you're better than your teammates, you should be the one to be considerate.
[EA00 Rammi]Rammi, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal who you really are. What should we answer?
	Just playing soccer, that's all.
[EA00 Rammi]Rammi says to you that it was an honor to be able to play with you. Let's give her an answer.
	I'm starting to enjoy playing with you.
[EA00 Rammi]You're having a conversation with Rammi about the power of Spirit Stones which is covered in secrets. Let's tell her what you think.
	I need a Spirit Stone that's as fancy as I am.
[EA00 Rammi]Rammi is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''
	Let's do this! I'm at your disposal!
[EA00 Rammi]Let's talk to Rammi who recently started to take interest in the world of angels.
	I hope it's not a boring place.
[EA00 Rammi]Rammi is asking you if you ever saw the World Tree. Let's tell her your thoughts.
	Let's not talk about anything irrelevant to the match.
[EA00 Rammi]The teammates are speaking highly of Rammi, saying she's a good role model. Let's add in.
	She shows dominance with elegance.
[EA00 Rammi]You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?
	I'm considering making an anonymous donation.
[EA00 Rammi]Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Rammi wants to say a word.
	Get yourselves together, guys. Are you going to give up already?
[EA00 Rammi]You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.
	It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.
[EA00 Rammi]Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?
	Pathetic. We'll show them that we're better in many ways.
[EA00 Rammi]The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?
	A square match is what suites a proud royalty.
[EA00 Rammi]Rammi points out that the time the men of Minerva died and the time the epidemic broke out in Metro City matches.
	It would disgust me if that was the result of an evil plot.
[EA00 Rammi]Mortor and Wizol of the Peacemakers are helping an old man. Rammi seems to be surprised.
	It's good to know that they're not shallow people.
[EA00 Rammi]A big fight broke out between an angel and a demon within the team. Rammi is asking for help.
	I'm going to pick sides of the one I like.
[EA00 Rammi]Cracsus threatens to hack Rammi's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?
	[+1]Don't fall for this cheap shot.
[EA00 Rammi]Rammi is thinking about what Selena said about saving the galaxy if we win the Galaxy League.
	It's not good to just believe what others say.
[EA00 Rammi]Rammi is thinking about what the Universe of Oblivion is.
	Don't be scared about such petty things.

[EA01 Luka]You find Luka depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.
	It's not your fault that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!
[EA01 Luka]Luka is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.
	Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes. You're a precious part of this team.
[EA01 Luka]You come across Luka being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.
	Don't use that ability on the field...
[EA01 Luka]Luka is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.
	Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes, will you?
[EA01 Luka]Luka is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.
	I'll sleep by your side tonight.
[EA01 Luka]Luka is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.
[EA01 Luka]Luka seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	Perfect! No mistakes made!
[EA01 Luka]You come across Luka who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?
	I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.
[EA01 Luka]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.
[EA01 Luka]You're watching the storm with Luka and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!
[EA01 Luka]Luka looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.
[EA01 Luka]Luka's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Luka seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	I think that player likes you.
[EA01 Luka]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Luka.
	You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.
[EA01 Luka]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!
[EA01 Luka]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Luka and her opponent isn't over yet.
	Hey! The match is over!
[EA01 Luka]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Luka do?
	(Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.)
[EA01 Luka]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.
[EA01 Luka]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Luka. What should you say?
	Well, you're as cute as Luka.
[EA01 Luka]Luka is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Don't come over here! It's dangerous!
[EA01 Luka]Latios is chatting with Luka after the match. Let's barge in.
	Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's our pretty girl.

[EA01 Luka]Luka is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.
	What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?
[EA01 Luka]Luka, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.
[EA01 Luka]Luka announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	You'll have to compete with me!
[EA01 Luka]Luka is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
	Come on, cheer up. You're not being yourself.
[EA01 Luka]Luka wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
	It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.
[EA01 Luka]It seems that Luka is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Listen carefully and you'll find her.
[EA01 Luka]You find Luka lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!
[EA01 Luka]Luka says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Hmm? That is odd...What do you think about this?
[EA01 Luka]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!
[EA01 Luka]Luka wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	What about just watching?
[EA01 Luka]Luka caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	You came to see my marvelous moves? I'm flattered. 
[EA01 Luka]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Luka some orders.
	Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!
[EA01 Luka]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	Stop right there, pig!
[EA01 Luka]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Luka seems to be worried.
	Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.
[EA01 Luka]Luka came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?
[EA01 Luka]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...It's about to go down...! Where's the popcorn?
[EA01 Luka]Luka is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	Who could've done such a hideous thing?
[EA01 Luka]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Luka seems to be sick of this.
	Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Luka!
[EA01 Luka]Luka looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	How about we ask Jeunese?
[EA01 Luka]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Luka to set some simple rules.
	Come on, I'll show you the best spots around!

[EA01 Raiden]Raiden is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.
	It's all thanks to you.
[EA01 Raiden]After a meeting, Raiden's eyes met yours a several times and Raiden asks if he has something on his face.
	I was just thinking the team became stronger, thanks to you.
[EA01 Raiden]With a serious look on his face, Raiden warns you to go to the bathroom before the match.
	I'm surprised you said that. I won't ask what happened to you.
[EA01 Raiden]Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Raiden on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?
	You and I are already perfect. So I guess that means we shouldn't be saying our names.
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden is worried that he has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous things. What should we tell him?
	You're the most dangerous of them all.
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to him.
	Let's go tell the manager.
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden is asking if you have a special person who you would like to share happy moments with. Let's give him an answer.
	I think that may be you.
[EA01 Raiden]You find Raiden being very excited after performing an awesome play. How will you react?
	Nice play! Fantastic!
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden is having trouble focusing on the match. Let's help him out.
	Just calm down a bit. You got this.
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.
	He's just material for leveling up.
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden doesn't like the new team advertisement video.
	It didn't portray your awesome performance.
[EA01 Raiden]It's Raiden's birthday. Let's give him a present.
	This is a championship trophy replica for you. The designs are inspired by you.
[EA01 Raiden]You see Raiden's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Raiden. What should we do?
	He is probably not even listening...
[EA01 Raiden]The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?
	It's time for some good food.
[EA01 Raiden]You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also Raiden's rival, has been severely injured and is in the hospital. What should you say to him?
	This won't be the end of your rival. 
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden comes to you and says that he has to leave the team because of personal reasons. What should we say?
	Well, I don't want to be the one holding you back. Good luck!
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with Raiden.
	I'll try to have the ball come your way.
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.
	Pathetic...That is no king.
[EA01 Raiden]You got a couple of tickets to Veronica's live concert. Raiden seems to be interested.
	These are for you, of course. Here.
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden says he wants to cry because the goal keeper on the other team just won't go down no matter how many shots he makes.
	Let's come up with a new strategy to give you more synergy.

[EA01 Raiden]Raiden is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give him an answer.
	Wreck the other team.
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden, who is determined to make everything in his life, even his dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	It was an intense feeling as if I was going against the strongest team in the universe.
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden announces that he will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give him an answer.
	I feel bad for the players that have to face you.
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to him?
	Stop whining. I like it better when you're arrogant and sarcastic.
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. He wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to him.
	I'm surprised you care so much for your friends.
[EA01 Raiden]It seems that Raiden is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Let's ask Khirel to find him...
[EA01 Raiden]You find Raiden lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hmm, I guess you're more domestic than I thought.
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden says he doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. He thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	I think you two have something in common...
[EA01 Raiden]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	Don't kill him, okay?
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	Sure. Let's beat them all and take the prize money!
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	I think we should hang him.
[EA01 Raiden]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Raiden some orders.
	Make him know who he's up against.
[EA01 Raiden]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!
[EA01 Raiden]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Raiden seems to be worried.
	Weakling. Should've been rougher on that player.
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I'm sure you got scammed.
[EA01 Raiden]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	James and Bora...Who's the villain? 
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer him up?
	We'll find the ones that did this and use them as fertilizers.
[EA01 Raiden]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Raiden seems to be sick of this.
	Iron Claw!
[EA01 Raiden]Raiden looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.
[EA01 Raiden]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Raiden to set some simple rules.
	This team is a mess. Gather everybody on the field. I'll knock that spirit back into you guys if I have to.

[EA08 Vayne]Vayne is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell her?

[EA08 Vayne]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some advice.
	Be true to yourself.
[EA08 Vayne]Vayne is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.
	I'm sure you're going to become an intergalactic fool.
[EA08 Vayne]Vayne is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to her.
	We must have faith in the Gate Keepers and win the Galaxy League.
[EA08 Vayne]Vayne is making a scene. She'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.

	This needs to be analyzed and fixed. Can you help me?
[EA08 Vayne]Vayne is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to her?
	No, it's not boring.
[EA08 Vayne]It's before the 2nd half, and Vayne is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.
	Don't give up until the end.
[EA08 Vayne]You forgot to lock Vayne and almost used her as training material! She looks very upset!
	It's my fault.
[EA08 Vayne]Vayne is confused that she won the MVP. What should you tell her?
	You deserve it. Well done!
[EA08 Vayne]Vayne is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	I would've been doing something to save the universe.
[EA08 Vayne]The team is saying bad things about Vayne for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
	Do you really think that she would skip practice?
[EA08 Vayne]Vayne is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	I can feel the strength of that majestic creature.
[EA08 Vayne]Vayne seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to her.

	I'd love to have a stable job first.

	I've never dreamt about soccer.
[EA08 Vayne]Vayne announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	I have faith in you.
[EA08 Vayne]Vayne is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
	That doesn't change what we must do.
[EA08 Vayne]Vayne wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
	Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
[EA08 Vayne]It seems that Vayne is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Vayne? Nah, she never gets lost.
[EA08 Vayne]You find Vayne lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[EA08 Vayne]Vayne says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
[EA08 Vayne]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[EA08 Vayne]Vayne wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
[EA08 Vayne]Vayne caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[EA08 Vayne]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Vayne some orders.

	You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]As Ari (Swimsuit) said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.
	I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]The crowd is cheering for Ari (Swimsuit). Ari (Swimsuit) seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.
	How about just accepting the compliments for today?
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.
	The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.
	It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]The team will not have a match for some time. Ari (Swimsuit) asks you about your plan.
	I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]It's a very intense match and Ari (Swimsuit) falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Ari (Swimsuit) up and the two exchange smiles.
	Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Ari (Swimsuit) having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?

	That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!

	He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?
	If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Ari (Swimsuit). Let's talk to her.
	(Ignore.)
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Ari (Swimsuit) is curious and wants to take a look.
	We should probably ignore them and just walk by.
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	Throw it away. NOW.

[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?
	Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.

	I'm going to make a joke before I start crying!
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.
	Do you think they'll be tasty?
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?
	Do you think any of those comets are populated?
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.
	Teach them how adults play soccer.
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.
	Beginner level monsters in an RPG game.
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.
	That's deep. I think it's cool.
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry.
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?
	Don't forget that we exist! Haha!
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?
	Please don't forget about the match.
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) says she's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.
	Is her name really Kiki?
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Ari (Swimsuit) seems to be troubled. What should we do?
	If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	We should think about how to make fun of her when she comes back.
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	Maybe Sophie is actually a male...?
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Ari (Swimsuit) hands you a present.
	(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)
[EA14 Ari (Swimsuit)]Ari (Swimsuit) says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.
	Maybe she's up to something.

[EA14 Ravi]Ravi is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell her?
	Teamwork is what matters the most.
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I have very specific standards for personality, looks, values, and background. Are you interested in hearing about it?
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
	I would like to hear what you think is the best team in the universe.
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing any problems.
	That team is far from your style.
[EA14 Ravi]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some advice.
	Is winning really worth going that far?
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.
	I..Respect your naming taste...
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to her.
	A mysterious villain...Bad taste, if you ask me.
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi is making a scene. She'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.
	Vicious? More like ugly.
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.
	Passes that you prefer aren't always the right answer.
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to her?
	If you're up for suggestions, I'm all ears.
[EA14 Ravi]It's before the 2nd half, and Ravi is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.
	We should at least put up a fight so they remember us.
[EA14 Ravi]You forgot to lock Ravi and almost used her as training material! She looks very upset!
	It was all just to motivate you to become a better player!
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi is confused that she won the MVP. What should you tell her?
	Aren't you satisfied with your performance?
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	I would've tried to find something that fits me.
[EA14 Ravi]The team is saying bad things about Ravi for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
	Skipping practice isn't something that's in her dictionary.
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	Hmm...If only I could change the shape of the horns and the color of the scales. That'd be perfect.
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to her. 
	Everybody should grow up.
[EA14 Ravi]On a day off, Ravi is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
	It's really hard to find the right person.
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I want my dreams to come true.)
[EA14 Ravi]There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?
	What's done is done. Let's come up with a new design.

[EA14 Ravi]Ravi is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.
	We need a decent level of personal performance.
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've never dreamt about soccer.
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	I have faith in you.
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
	That doesn't change what we must do.
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
	Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
[EA14 Ravi]It seems that Ravi is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Ravi? Nah, she never gets lost.
[EA14 Ravi]You find Ravi lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
[EA14 Ravi]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[EA14 Ravi]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Ravi some orders.
	Let's try out some forward passes.
[EA14 Ravi]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	It's time we use him as training material.
[EA14 Ravi]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Ravi seems to be worried.
	It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I hope that wasn't all you got.
[EA14 Ravi]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...We should get out of here.
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
[EA14 Ravi]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Ravi seems to be sick of this.
	Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
[EA14 Ravi]Ravi looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	It's space. Anything can exist here.
[EA14 Ravi]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Ravi to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

[EA42 Vanity]Vanity is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.
	Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?
	It's the place of dreams colliding.
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	Why don't you join them and find out?
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.
	Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.
	Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.
	My fans!
[EA42 Vanity]This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?
	Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	He'll remember someday.
[EA42 Vanity]The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.
	Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.
[EA42 Vanity]Ogre's pony tail slapped Vanity in the face!
	That must hurt.
[EA42 Vanity]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.
	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[EA42 Vanity]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[EA42 Vanity]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[EA42 Vanity]Vanity says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?
	Of course! Everybody is counting on you!
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give her a sincere answer.
	I want to see everybody smile. I think that'll make me happy.
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.
	I'd like to keep one as a pet.
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?
	Where do you think those comets are going?
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.
	Yeah, I mean they could get hurt.
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.
	I'm planning to make a whole line of merchandise with them as the character.
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.
	Life is a light of its own.
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	Just hear them out and smile. They'll feel better.
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	I sense that there's something she hasn't told us yet...
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?
	Congratulations! How did you guys get along?
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?
	You're playing soccer! You're fine!
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity says she's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.
	Tell her to be our lap cat.
[EA42 Vanity]Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Vanity seems to be troubled. What should we do?
	If you guys keep giving Vanity trouble, I swear to god I'll use you both as special training material.
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	She seems like a nice girl.
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	Vanity is in danger! We have to save her!
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	She must've made a mistake.
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	We can do this! Let's go!
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	Yeah, they get along pretty well.
[EA42 Vanity]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Vanity hands you a present.
	(A cute and pretty pendant)
[EA42 Vanity]Vanity says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.
	I think she likes him.

[EA43 Haru]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Haru asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	What, are you expecting something like ''I feel like I'm in heaven'' or something?
[EA43 Haru]Haru suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.
[EA43 Haru]Haru is saying that his teammates are what keeps him going.
	(Just nod your head.)
[EA43 Haru]Haru has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. He is asking for your evaluation on his plays. Let's give him an answer.
	You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.
[EA43 Haru]As Haru said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to him.
	I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.
[EA43 Haru]The crowd is cheering for Haru. Haru seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help him out.
	How about just accepting the compliments for today?
[EA43 Haru]Haru is impressed by the help he received from the elementals. Let's talk to him.
	The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.
[EA43 Haru]Haru was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin himself. Let's talk to him.
	It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!
[EA43 Haru]The team will not have a match for some time. Haru asks you about your plan.
	I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.
[EA43 Haru]It's a very intense match and Haru falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Haru up and the two exchange smiles.
	Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?
[EA43 Haru]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.
[EA43 Haru]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Haru having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	...I see two idiots standing in front of me...
[EA43 Haru]Haru is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to him.
	I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.
[EA43 Haru]Haru scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate him!
	That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!
[EA43 Haru]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Haru.
	He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.
[EA43 Haru]Haru falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to him?
	If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.
[EA43 Haru]Haru lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...
[EA43 Haru]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Haru. Let's talk to her.
	(Ignore.)
[EA43 Haru]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Haru is curious and wants to take a look.
	We should probably ignore them and just walk by.
[EA43 Haru]Haru brought a drink that he says he received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	Throw it away. NOW.

[EA43 Haru]Haru is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to him.
	It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy! This is nonsense!
[EA43 Haru]Haru is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help him?
	It's stressful because we can't prepare for extraterrestrial sanitation. We're completely exposed to all those unknown...things.
[EA43 Haru]Haru wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	Perfect planning and perfect execution.
[EA43 Haru]Haru is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became his life. Let's talk with him.
	Life, eh? I guess that's a bit too serious for me, but I think I understand how you feel.
[EA43 Haru]Haru is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give him an opinion.
	How about some presents for your parents?
[EA43 Haru]Haru is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.
	My teammates and their flawless play!
[EA43 Haru]This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?
	I heard that the bath products on Earth are the best in the universe.
[EA43 Haru]Haru says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	That's bad. I'm sure it's something important!
[EA43 Haru]The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.
	I can't stand this...I need to end this quickly and go take a shower.
[EA43 Haru]Haru seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	The eyepatch...I wonder if she washes it. She seems to have it on at all times.
[EA43 Haru]Ogre's pony tail slapped Haru in the face!
	Ugh...Gross...
[EA43 Haru]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.
[EA43 Haru]Haru is suddenly showing massive improvement in his performance. He must've learned something during a match.
	You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.
[EA43 Haru]Haru says that the Swirlies are missing.
	I evolved them.
[EA43 Haru]Haru says he forgot to use his skill points before entering the match. What should we say to him?
	That's unacceptable!
[EA43 Haru]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	Ugh...I want to dig my eyes out.
[EA43 Haru]Haru picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Let's contact her and return this.
[EA43 Haru]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	Well, now what?
[EA43 Haru]Haru is irritated because his opponent has the attribute advantage over him.
	Do I have to stop the match?
[EA43 Haru]Haru thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Hmm, her tail is a bit weird and her ears are definitely human...

[EA82 Nikita]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Nikita asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	What, are you expecting something like ''I feel like I can fly'' or something?
[EA82 Nikita]Nikita suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.
[EA82 Nikita]Nikita is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.

[EA82 Nikita]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	Ugh...I want to dig my eyes out.
[EA82 Nikita]Nikita picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Let's contact her and return this.
[EA82 Nikita]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	Well, now what?
[EA82 Nikita]Nikita is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.
	Do I have to stop the match?
[EA82 Nikita]Nikita thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Hmm, her tail is a bit weird and her ears are definitely human...

[Elaine]You find Elaine depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.
	It's not your fault that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!
[Elaine]Elaine is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.
	Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes. You're a precious part of this team.
[Elaine]You come across Elaine being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.
	Don't use that ability on the field...

	Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes, will you?
[Elaine]Elaine is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.
	I'll sleep by your side tonight.
[Elaine]Elaine is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.
[Elaine]Elaine seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	Perfect! No mistakes made!
[Elaine]You come across Elaine who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?
	I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.
[Elaine]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.
[Elaine]You're watching the storm with Elaine and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!
[Elaine]Elaine looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.
[Elaine]Elaine's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Elaine seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	I think that player likes you.
[Elaine]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Elaine.
	You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.
[Elaine]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!
[Elaine]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Elaine and her opponent isn't over yet.
	Hey! The match is over!
[Elaine]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Elaine do?
	(Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.)
[Elaine]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.
[Elaine]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Elaine. What should you say?
	Well, you're as cute as Elaine.
[Elaine]Elaine is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Don't come over here! It's dangerous!
[Elaine]Latios is chatting with Elaine after the match. Let's barge in.
	Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's our pretty girl.

[Elaine]Elaine is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.
	We need a decent level of personal performance.
[Elaine]Elaine, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've never dreamt about soccer.
[Elaine]Elaine announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	I have faith in you.
[Elaine]Elaine is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
	That doesn't change what we must do.
[Elaine]Elaine wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
	Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
[Elaine]It seems that Elaine is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Elaine? Nah, she never gets lost.
[Elaine]You find Elaine lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[Elaine]Elaine says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
[Elaine]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[Elaine]Elaine wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
[Elaine]Elaine caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[Elaine]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Elaine some orders.
	Let's try out some forward passes.
[Elaine]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	It's time we use him as training material.
[Elaine]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Elaine seems to be worried.
	It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.
[Elaine]Elaine came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I hope that wasn't all you got.
[Elaine]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...We should get out of here.
[Elaine]Elaine is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
[Elaine]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Elaine seems to be sick of this.
	Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
[Elaine]Elaine looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	It's space. Anything can exist here.
[Elaine]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Elaine to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

[Elchitusa]You find Elchitusa depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.
	It's not your fault that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!

	Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's our pretty girl.

[Elchitusa]Elchitusa is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.
	What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?
[Elchitusa]Elchitusa, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.
[Elchitusa]Elchitusa announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	You'll have to compete with me!
[Elchitusa]Elchitusa is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
	Come on, cheer up. You're not being yourself.
[Elchitusa]Elchitusa wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
	It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.
[Elchitusa]It seems that Elchitusa is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Listen carefully and you'll find her.
[Elchitusa]You find Elchitusa lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!
[Elchitusa]Elchitusa says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Hmm? That is odd...What do you think about this?
[Elchitusa]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!
[Elchitusa]Elchitusa wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	What about just watching?
[Elchitusa]Elchitusa caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	You came to see my marvelous moves? I'm flattered. 
[Elchitusa]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Elchitusa some orders.
	Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!
[Elchitusa]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	Stop right there, pig!
[Elchitusa]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Elchitusa seems to be worried.
	Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.
[Elchitusa]Elchitusa came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?
[Elchitusa]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...It's about to go down...! Where's the popcorn?
[Elchitusa]Elchitusa is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	Who could've done such a hideous thing?
[Elchitusa]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Elchitusa seems to be sick of this.
	Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Elchitusa!
[Elchitusa]Elchitusa looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	How about we ask Jeunese?
[Elchitusa]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Elchitusa to set some simple rules.
	Come on, I'll show you the best spots around!

[Elicia]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Elicia asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	What, are you expecting something like ''I feel like I can fly'' or something?
[Elicia]Elicia suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.
[Elicia]Elicia is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.
	(Just nod your head.)
[Elicia]Elicia has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.
	You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.
[Elicia]As Elicia said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.
	I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.
[Elicia]The crowd is cheering for Elicia. Elicia seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.
	How about just accepting the compliments for today?
[Elicia]Elicia is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.
	The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.
[Elicia]Elicia was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.
	It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!
[Elicia]The team will not have a match for some time. Elicia asks you about your plan.
	I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.
[Elicia]It's a very intense match and Elicia falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Elicia up and the two exchange smiles.
	Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?
[Elicia]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.
[Elicia]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Elicia having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	...I see two idiots standing in front of me...
[Elicia]Elicia is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.
	I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.
[Elicia]Elicia scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!
	That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!
[Elicia]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Elicia.
	He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.
[Elicia]Elicia falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?
	If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.
[Elicia]Elicia lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...
[Elicia]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Elicia. Let's talk to her.
	(Ignore.)
[Elicia]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Elicia is curious and wants to take a look.
	We should probably ignore them and just walk by.
[Elicia]Elicia brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	Throw it away. NOW.

[Elicia]Elicia is asking you what you think is it that makes this team great. You weren't expecting this, but you should give her an answer.
	You. I know you're doing much for the team without taking any credit.
[Elicia]Elicia is angry because she was criticized by her performance and is asking your opinion. Let's give her an answer.
	I want to practice with you, if that's okay with you. No?
[Elicia]Elicia, who has shown absolutely superb chemistry with you, is embarrassed and says she didn't do all of that because of you. What should we say?
	Yeah? Well, I did what I did for you.
[Elicia]Elicia wants to have an academic conversation about the 5th dimension, string theory, and other infamously hard space theories. Why...?
	(Maybe she brought snacks but is too shy to share it with me.)
[Elicia]Elicia looks disappointed about the size of the Galaxy League. What would be an appropriate response?
	Nervous? Trust me. I got you.
[Elicia]Elicia seems to be uncomfortable to hear about the love life of other teammates. Let's talk to her.
	Should we join the club?
[Elicia]Elicia is talking about how famous her rivals are in the Galaxy League. She seems jealous. Let's talk to her.
	I'll be your rival from now.
[Elicia]Elicia is furious about how Lucian is always surrounded by girls. What should we say?
	Are you jealous?
[Elicia]Kirin suddenly appears, pats Elicia on the head while teasing her, and then goes away. Elicia seems angry...
	...I think you liked it more than you thought...
[Elicia]The team is at Metro City. Elicia seems to be surprised how the people of Metro City have mechanical bodies.
	You have a heart of gold.
[Elicia]Kuma is furiously chasing Ogre. Elicia seems confused.
	Two bears...Which one is Kuma?
[Elicia]Elicia is spreading the happy news about her cousin having a baby. Let's congratulate her.
	So, the numerous baby clothes you've been making were all for this day?
[Elicia]The team seems very nervous facing Skalardra. What should we do?
	Huh? I think Elicia is prettier.
[Elicia]Elicia refuses to listen to anybody's advice saying he's the best and he doesn't need any advice. Let's talk to her.
	Are you angry because I wasn't there to oversee your training? I said I'm sorry!
[Elicia]Elicia is interested in Selena and is asking for your opinion. What should we say?
	Be honest and show a sincere attitude.
[Elicia]Elicia seems to be interested in the Micrinum from Kiri, which is said to be good for beauty and anti-aging. Let's talk to her.
	You're young and good looking even without that.
[Elicia]Elicia seems to be determined to crush the opposing team. Let's give her some advice.
	That's the spirit! Let's teach them a lesson!
[Elicia]Elicia looks sad because she feels her friendship with a friend in a rival team is falling apart. What should we say to her?
	Try starting off with some small talk.
[Elicia]It's a tough match, but Elicia is standing tall and encouraging the team. What should we say to her?
	Your spirit is an inspiration to us all.
[Elicia]A teammate that is a former member of the Dark Sisters is down sick, suffering from the aftermath of performing exorcism. Let's talk with Elicia about what to do.
	Let's go visit her. Some fun won't do any harm. It might even cheer her up!

[Elise]Elise is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.
	Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.
[Elise]Elise is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?
	It's the place of dreams colliding.
[Elise]Elise wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	Why don't you join them and find out?
[Elise]Elise is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.
	Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!
[Elise]Elise is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.
	Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!
[Elise]Elise is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.
	My fans!
[Elise]This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?
	Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.
[Elise]Elise says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	He'll remember someday.
[Elise]The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.
	Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!
[Elise]Elise seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.
[Elise]Ogre's pony tail slapped Elise in the face!
	That must hurt.
[Elise]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
[Elise]Elise is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.
	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[Elise]Elise says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[Elise]Elise says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[Elise]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Elise]Elise picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[Elise]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Elise]Elise is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[Elise]Elise thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[Elise]Elise seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.
	They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.
[Elise]With a serious face, Elise is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.
	A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?
[Elise]Elise came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	Just please go with that boring strategy.
[Elise]Elise is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.
	They're on cooldown.
[Elise]The team is having a good run and Elise is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	As long as we're not used as training material...
[Elise]Elise seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)
[Elise]Elise seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.
	Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.
[Elise]Elise is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.
	Well, having a good ace skill is a start.
[Elise]Elise is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.
[Elise]Elise plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	I'm thinking of opening a shop.
[Elise]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Elise and talk about what to do.
	I hope they have a ''Continue'' button around here.
[Elise]Elise seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.
	Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!
[Elise]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	Cool! Awesome!
[Elise]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	Has he gone mad?
[Elise]Elise's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?
	Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.
[Elise]During a match, Elise bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?
	Wasn't that a glitch?
[Elise]Elise is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.
	I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.
[Elise]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.
[Elise]Elise is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.
[Elise]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Elise is starting to get intimidated.
	He's obviously obsessed with soccer.

[Elizabeth]Elizabeth is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.
	Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.

	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[Elizabeth]Elizabeth says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?
	I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.
[Elizabeth]Elizabeth asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give her a sincere answer.
	I guess I'll be chasing you on the road of glory.
[Elizabeth]Elizabeth is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.
	I think they're cute and elegant if you leave out the pig and bear. 
[Elizabeth]Elizabeth looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?
	The space has prepared this beautiful stage for you.
[Elizabeth]Elizabeth says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.
	They're young but they have passion.
[Elizabeth]Elizabeth wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.
	Thankful beings that will be our +160.
[Elizabeth]Elizabeth is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.
	How about we make it to the top of the Galaxy League and shine the universe with the light within us?
[Elizabeth]Elizabeth says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	Tell them they should remember that they play for you.
[Elizabeth]Elizabeth says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	Did she think that you'll take over the throne?
[Elizabeth]Elizabeth seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?
	Good for you! I know it's hard for you to find someone at your level!
[Elizabeth]Elizabeth is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?
	I don't think you need to worry about a diet.
[Elizabeth]Elizabeth says she's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.

[Elizabeth]Elizabeth went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	I feel sorry for the other team.
[Elizabeth]Elizabeth claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	I don't care what the case is.
[Elizabeth]Elizabeth seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	Be careful not to be stomped on...
[Elizabeth]Elizabeth says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	That's strange. I thought he was more of an authoritative character.
[Elizabeth]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Elizabeth hands you a present.
	(A chocker with a pretty radical design.)
[Elizabeth]Elizabeth says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.
	That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy, and love.

[Elliot]Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Elliot is asking how he did in the match.
	It was pretty scary watching you so pleased with the rough plays of the opponents.
[Elliot]Elliot looks excited as he's talking with the team about pets. He turns around and asks you what kind of pet you like.
	I like cats. I like the egoistic side of them.
[Elliot]You come across Elliot thinking about the value of soccer. What should we tell him?
	I'm sure you can find pleasure inside of the violence of the field.
[Elliot]Elliot is having trouble focusing on the match because of the affectionate emotion he feels. He says he must leave now to propose to his lover. What should we say?
	You will be happy, while that feeling lasts.
[Elliot]Elliot blushes up and tells you that he's happy he can play soccer with you. What should we tell him?
	Hmm, I'll prepare a rougher match.
[Elliot]Elliot is asking for special training sessions because he's not satisfied with today's performance. What should we tell him?
	Good. I'll train you until you can't stand up.
[Elliot]Elliot did his best, but he failed to achieve the results he wanted and looks sad. We should say something to him.
	That wasn't enough! You have to try harder!
[Elliot]Elliot is asking you about what you like besides soccer.
	Boxing. I like that feeling when I get hit by a punch.
[Elliot]Elliot feels his heart races when he sees Littre.
	...Do you want to spend the rest of your life being with an abusive herbivore like alien creature? 
[Elliot]Kuma is caught sneaking in the woman's locker room once again. We should talk with Elliot about what to do with him.
	Let's make him put on Elliot's underwear.
[Elliot]Elliot continues to charge into the opponent's defense line and keeps failing. What should we do?
	(He looks happy. Let's let him be.)
[Elliot]Elliot is being annoying with his offensive words. What should we do?
	(Slap him.)
[Elliot]It's dinner time and Elliot is staring at his carrot soup with a troubled look. What should we do?
	(Tell him to put the carrots in the soup on Hildegard's plate.)
[Elliot]It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking up for the morning training. What should we tell Elliot to do?
	(Step on everyone that's still sleeping.)
[Elliot]Elliot says that the soup tastes funny. What should we do?
	It's fine. Eat up.
[Elliot]Elliot is furious about the referee that's clearly favoring the other team. Should we stop him?
	The tougher it gets, the better it feels to win. Right?
[Elliot]It suddenly began to rain heavily. You see Elliot running up ahead.
	(Run past him and smile.)
[Elliot]You witnessed a player on the other side putting a tack in Elliot's shoe.
	(Ignore it.)
[Elliot]During the team meeting, you find a player sleeping. What should you do?
	(Slap the player in the back of the head.)
[Elliot]Elliot hurt his leg during the 1st half of the match, but he insists on playing. What should we tell him?
	It seems as if pain is what keeps you going...

[Elliot]Elliot is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to him.
	Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.
[Elliot]Elliot is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help him?
	It's the place of dreams colliding.
[Elliot]Elliot wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	Why don't you join them and find out?
[Elliot]Elliot is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became his life. Let's talk with him.
	Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!
[Elliot]Elliot is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give him an opinion.
	Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!
[Elliot]Elliot is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.
	My fans!
[Elliot]This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?
	Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.
[Elliot]Elliot says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	He'll remember someday.
[Elliot]The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.
	Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!
[Elliot]Elliot seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.
[Elliot]Ogre's pony tail slapped Elliot in the face!
	That must hurt.
[Elliot]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
[Elliot]Elliot is suddenly showing massive improvement in his performance. He must've learned something during a match.
	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[Elliot]Elliot says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[Elliot]Elliot says he forgot to use his skill points before entering the match. What should we say to him?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[Elliot]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Elliot]Elliot picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[Elliot]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Elliot]Elliot is irritated because his opponent has the attribute advantage over him.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[Elliot]Elliot thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[Elua]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Elua asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	Wow. I'm sooooo happy.
[Elua]Elua suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.
[Elua]Elua is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.
	(Pat her on the head.)
[Elua]Elua has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.
	I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.
[Elua]As Elua said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.
	I'm sure it's going in a good direction.
[Elua]The crowd is cheering for Elua. Elua seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.
	They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.
[Elua]Elua is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.
	I am so thankful to them.
[Elua]Elua was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.
	Oh, that'll be so cute!
[Elua]The team will not have a match for some time. Elua asks you about your plan.
	Hmm, wanna go shopping?
[Elua]It's a very intense match and Elua falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Elua up and the two exchange smiles.
	That player must have a heart of gold.
[Elua]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
[Elua]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Elua having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?
[Elua]Elua is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.
	Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.
[Elua]Elua scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!
	Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?
[Elua]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Elua.
	It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.
[Elua]Elua falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?
	Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.
[Elua]Elua lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?
[Elua]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Elua. Let's talk to her.
	Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.
[Elua]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Elua is curious and wants to take a look.
	They must love volunteer work!
[Elua]Elua brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...

[Elua]You find Elua depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.
	It's not your fault that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!
[Elua]Elua is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.
	Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes. You're a precious part of this team.
[Elua]You come across Elua being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.
	Don't use that ability on the field...
[Elua]Elua is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.
	Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes, will you?
[Elua]Elua is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.
	I'll sleep by your side tonight.
[Elua]Elua is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.
[Elua]Elua seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	Perfect! No mistakes made!
[Elua]You come across Elua who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?
	I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.
[Elua]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.
[Elua]You're watching the storm with Elua and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!
[Elua]Elua looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.
[Elua]Elua's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Elua seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	I think that player likes you.
[Elua]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Elua.
	You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.
[Elua]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!
[Elua]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Elua and her opponent isn't over yet.
	Hey! The match is over!
[Elua]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Elua do?
	(Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.)
[Elua]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.
[Elua]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Elua. What should you say?
	Well, you're as cute as Elua.
[Elua]Elua is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Don't come over here! It's dangerous!
[Elua]Latios is chatting with Elua after the match. Let's barge in.
	Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's our pretty girl.

[Enthia]Enthia is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell her?
	Best of 4 should be our goal.
[Enthia]Enthia is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I think that being able to understand each other is the most important.
[Enthia]Enthia seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
	It's within our grasp.
[Enthia]Enthia is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing any problems.
	The honor of our opponent is also important.
[Enthia]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some advice.
	Be true to yourself.
[Enthia]Enthia is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.
	I'm sure you're going to become an intergalactic fool.
[Enthia]Enthia is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to her.
	We must have faith in the Gate Keepers and win the Galaxy League.
[Enthia]Enthia is making a scene. She'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.
	Are you giving up before putting up a fight?
[Enthia]Enthia is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.
	This needs to be analyzed and fixed. Can you help me?
[Enthia]Enthia is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to her?
	No, it's not boring.
[Enthia]It's before the 2nd half, and Enthia is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.
	Don't give up until the end.
[Enthia]You forgot to lock Enthia and almost used her as training material! She looks very upset!
	It's my fault.
[Enthia]Enthia is confused that she won the MVP. What should you tell her?
	You deserve it. Well done!
[Enthia]Enthia is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	I would've been doing something to save the universe.
[Enthia]The team is saying bad things about Enthia for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
	Do you really think that she would skip practice?
[Enthia]Enthia is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	I can feel the strength of that majestic creature.
[Enthia]Enthia seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to her. 
	Let's go look for her.
[Enthia]On a day off, Enthia is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
	I'd love to have a stable job first.
[Enthia]Enthia is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I just don't want to waste a single day in my life.)
[Enthia]There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?
	Let's split up and find the uniforms.

[Enthia]Enthia says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?

	I want to see everybody smile. I think that'll make me happy.
[Enthia]Enthia is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.
	I'd like to keep one as a pet.
[Enthia]Enthia looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?
	Where do you think those comets are going?
[Enthia]Enthia says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.
	Yeah, I mean they could get hurt.
[Enthia]Enthia wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.
	I'm planning to make a whole line of merchandise with them as the character.
[Enthia]Enthia is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.
	Life is a light of its own.
[Enthia]Enthia says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	Just hear them out and smile. They'll feel better.
[Enthia]Enthia says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	I sense that there's something she hasn't told us yet...
[Enthia]Enthia seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?
	Congratulations! How did you guys get along?
[Enthia]Enthia is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?
	You're playing soccer! You're fine!
[Enthia]Enthia says she's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.
	Tell her to be our lap cat.

	If you guys keep giving Enthia trouble, I swear to god I'll use you both as special training material.
[Enthia]Enthia is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	She seems like a nice girl.
[Enthia]Enthia went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?

[Enthia]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Enthia hands you a present.
	(A cute and pretty pendant)

[Freyja]Freyja brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...

[Freyja]Freyja is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.
	We need a decent level of personal performance.
[Freyja]Freyja, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've never dreamt about soccer.
[Freyja]Freyja announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	I have faith in you.
[Freyja]Freyja is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
	That doesn't change what we must do.
[Freyja]Freyja wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
	Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
[Freyja]It seems that Freyja is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Freyja? Nah, she never gets lost.
[Freyja]You find Freyja lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[Freyja]Freyja says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
[Freyja]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[Freyja]Freyja wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
[Freyja]Freyja caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[Freyja]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Freyja some orders.
	Let's try out some forward passes.
[Freyja]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	It's time we use him as training material.
[Freyja]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Freyja seems to be worried.
	It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.
[Freyja]Freyja came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I hope that wasn't all you got.
[Freyja]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...We should get out of here.
[Freyja]Freyja is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
[Freyja]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Freyja seems to be sick of this.
	Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
[Freyja]Freyja looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	It's space. Anything can exist here.
[Freyja]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Freyja to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

[Freyja]Freyja is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.
	The opponents are mesmerized by the beauty of our players.
[Freyja]After a meeting, Freyja's eyes met yours a several times and Freyja asks if she has something on her face.
	Yeah, Kuma's hat...
[Freyja]With a serious look on her face, Freyja warns you to go to the bathroom before the match.
	Why does an ordinary advice sound so strange...
[Freyja]Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Freyja on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?
	I think it should be you, but will you be able to return to your normal life after all of this is...Wait, I'm going off topic, right?
[Freyja]Freyja is worried that she has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous things. What should we tell her?
	Look at the beautiful players! This is paradise!
[Freyja]Freyja is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to her.
	...If you want to say something, it's alright. I'll be listening.
[Freyja]Freyja is asking if you have a special person who you would like to share happy moments with. Let's give her an answer.
	My Nari dakimakura! She's the best idol in the universe and is super strong.
[Freyja]You find Freyja being very excited after performing an awesome play. How will you react?
	Can't you do that more often?! (Cries)
[Freyja]Freyja is having trouble focusing on the match. Let's help her out.
	It's impossible to focus on a field with so many handsome men.
[Freyja]Freyja is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.
	That bear...Is a hero...!
[Freyja]Freyja doesn't like the new team advertisement video.
	There's not enough fan service.
[Freyja]It's Freyja's birthday. Let's give her a present.
	I stole this treasure box from Kuma.
[Freyja]You see Freyja's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Freyja. What should we do?
	Tell me if you like her. Just say the words and I'll scout her.
[Freyja]The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?
	Manga, anime, and figures...! Here I come!
[Freyja]You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also Freyja's rival, has been severely injured and is in the hospital. What should you say to her?
	This is our chance to steal his precious collection.
[Freyja]Freyja comes to you and says that she has to leave the team because of personal reasons. What should we say?
	So, how does this work? Do I tap ''Sell''?
[Freyja]Freyja is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with Freyja.
	I think we should come up with an action speed deck or go for counterattacks...
[Freyja]Freyja is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.
	So, is that king entering the Galaxy League?
[Freyja]You got a couple of tickets to Veronica's live concert. Freyja seems to be interested.
	I'll give you this, so get rid of that fake ticket.
[Freyja]Freyja says she wants to cry because the goal keeper on the other team just won't go down no matter how many shots she makes.
	Let's start by picking their defenses apart.

[Furion]Furion is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.
	It's all thanks to you.
[Furion]After a meeting, Furion's eyes met yours a several times and Furion asks if he has something on his face.
	I was just thinking the team became stronger, thanks to you.
[Furion]With a serious look on his face, Furion warns you to go to the bathroom before the match.
	I'm surprised you said that. I won't ask what happened to you.
[Furion]Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Furion on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?
	You and I are already perfect. So I guess that means we shouldn't be saying our names.
[Furion]Furion is worried that he has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous things. What should we tell him?
	You're the most dangerous of them all.
[Furion]Furion is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to him.
	Let's go tell the manager.
[Furion]Furion is asking if you have a special person who you would like to share happy moments with. Let's give him an answer.

	Nice play! Fantastic!
[Furion]Furion is having trouble focusing on the match. Let's help him out.
	Just calm down a bit. You got this.
[Furion]Furion is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.
	He's just material for leveling up.
[Furion]Furion doesn't like the new team advertisement video.
	It didn't portray your awesome performance.
[Furion]It's Furion's birthday. Let's give him a present.
	This is a championship trophy replica for you. The designs are inspired by you.
[Furion]You see Furion's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Furion. What should we do?
	He is probably not even listening...
[Furion]The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?
	It's time for some good food.
[Furion]You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also Furion's rival, has been severely injured and is in the hospital. What should you say to him?
	This won't be the end of your rival.

	Well, I don't want to be the one holding you back. Good luck!

	I'll try to have the ball come your way.
[Furion]Furion is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.
	Pathetic...That is no king.

	These are for you, of course. Here.

[Furion]Furion seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to him.
	I'm starting to see true strength in this team.
[Furion]You come across Furion who is limping. He says it's nothing. What should we do?
	Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.
[Furion]You visit Merlin's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Can't you cook ramen by yourself?
[Furion]You're watching the storm with Furion and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	What's wrong with her?

	Littre will be fine.
[Furion]Furion's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Furion seems to be nervous. Let's talk to him.
	That player is just messing with you.
[Furion]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Furion.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Furion]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's give them a hand.
[Furion]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Furion and his opponent isn't over yet.

[Furion]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Furion do?

[Guinevere]Guinevere looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Littre will be fine.
[Guinevere]Guinevere's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Guinevere seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	That player is just messing with you.
[Guinevere]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Guinevere.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Guinevere]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's give them a hand.
[Guinevere]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Guinevere and her opponent isn't over yet.
	You better win that fight!
[Guinevere]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Guinevere do?
	(Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)
[Guinevere]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	They will never learn with an attitude like that.
[Guinevere]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Guinevere. What should you say?
	Well, Guinevere does have that kind of charm.
[Guinevere]Guinevere is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?

[Hamerus]Hamerus is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to her.

	This needs to be analyzed and fixed. Can you help me?

	No, it's not boring.
[Hamerus]It's before the 2nd half, and Hamerus is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.

[Hamerus]You forgot to lock Hamerus and almost used her as training material! She looks very upset!
	It's my fault.
[Hamerus]Hamerus is confused that she won the MVP. What should you tell her?
	You deserve it. Well done!
[Hamerus]Hamerus is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	I would've been doing something to save the universe.

	Do you really think that she would skip practice?

	Let's split up and find the uniforms.

[Hamerus]Hamerus is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	The other team went home crying!

	It's only a sport! The strongest team wins, and we are strong!

	Make the scouters fall in love with your performance!
[Hamerus]Hamerus isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
	We may have to go rough on the team and make them realize the problem.
[Hamerus]With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Hamerus for solutions.
	We won't be able to win the league if we fail to overcome this. 
[Hamerus]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	We're going to hunt that manager down and take back our money. We will show no mercy!
[Hamerus]You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Hamerus and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest. 
	There's no time for tears! Find out who did this and bring justice!
[Hamerus]Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
	The stage is so majestic! It's awesome!
[Hamerus]According to Hamerus's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
	William doesn't know how to respect his seniors.
[Hamerus]Hamerus thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
	...Sometimes, the truth is better to be left a secret.
[Hamerus]Hamerus won a trip around the world from a radio event!
	What about soccer? You'll have to go through me to go on that trip!

	Care to receive the ball with your face?
[Hamerus]You're sick and in bed when Hamerus and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?

[Hamerus]The match and the concert that Hamerus was looking for start at the same time...
	Channel that sorrow and rage towards your opponents and make them pay.
[Hamerus]Hamerus wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.

	Run! Just start running!

[Helen]Helen wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	Why don't you join them and find out?
[Helen]Helen is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.
	Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!
[Helen]Helen is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.

	I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.
[Helen]Ogre's pony tail slapped Helen in the face!
	That must hurt.
[Helen]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
[Helen]Helen is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.
	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[Helen]Helen says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[Helen]Helen says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[Helen]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Helen]Helen picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[Helen]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Helen]Helen is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[Helen]Helen thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[Helen]Helen seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.
	They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.
[Helen]With a serious face, Helen is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.
	A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?

	Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.
[Helen]Helen plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	I'm thinking of opening a shop.
[Helen]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Helen and talk about what to do.
	I hope they have a ''Continue'' button around here.
[Helen]Helen seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.
	Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!

	Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.

	Even his hair is a weapon! Is that even allowed?
[Hines]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?

[Hines]Hines is suddenly showing massive improvement in his performance. He must've learned something during a match.
	I knew this day would come.
[Hines]Hines says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.
[Hines]Hines says he forgot to use his skill points before entering the match. What should we say to him?

	We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.
[Horan]It's a very intense match and Horan falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Horan up and the two exchange smiles.
	True sportsmanship! Wonderful!
[Horan]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.
[Horan]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Horan having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	Save the energy for the match.

[Horan]Horan is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.
	I'll sleep by your side tonight.
[Horan]Horan is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?

[Horan]Horan seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	Perfect! No mistakes made!
[Horan]You come across Horan who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?

	She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!

	Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.
[Horan]Horan's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Horan seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	I think that player likes you.
[Horan]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Horan.
	You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.
[Horan]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!
[Horan]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Horan and her opponent isn't over yet.

[Horan]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Horan do?
	(Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.)

	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[Hyang Ran, the Shaman]Hyang Ran, the Shaman says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.

	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Hyang Ran, the Shaman]Hyang Ran, the Shaman picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[Hyang Ran, the Shaman]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Hyang Ran, the Shaman]Hyang Ran, the Shaman is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[Hyang Ran, the Shaman]Hyang Ran, the Shaman thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[Hyang Ran, the Shaman]Hyang Ran, the Shaman says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?
	Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.

	That's deep. I think it's cool.
[Hyang Ran, the Shaman]Hyang Ran, the Shaman says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.
[Hyang Ran, the Shaman]Hyang Ran, the Shaman says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry.

	Don't forget that we exist! Haha!

	If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?
[Hyang Ran, the Shaman]Hyang Ran, the Shaman is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.
[Hyang Ran, the Shaman]Hyang Ran, the Shaman went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	We should think about how to make fun of her when she comes back.
[Hyang Ran, the Shaman]Hyang Ran, the Shaman claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	Maybe Sophie is actually a male...?
[Hyang Ran, the Shaman]Hyang Ran, the Shaman seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?
[Hyang Ran, the Shaman]Hyang Ran, the Shaman says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.
[Hyang Ran, the Shaman]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Hyang Ran, the Shaman hands you a present.
	(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)
[Hyang Ran, the Shaman]Hyang Ran, the Shaman says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.

	You can overcome this like always. Right?
[Hyun]Hyun seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	I'm starting to see true strength in this team.
[Hyun]You come across Hyun who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?
	Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.
[Hyun]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Can't you cook ramen by yourself?
[Hyun]You're watching the storm with Hyun and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	What's wrong with her?
[Hyun]Hyun looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Littre will be fine.
[Hyun]Hyun's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Hyun seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.

	They will never learn with an attitude like that.
[Hyun]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Hyun. What should you say?
	Well, Hyun does have that kind of charm.
[Hyun]Hyun is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Can you peel this guy off of me?
[Hyun]Latios is chatting with Hyun after the match. Let's barge in.
	I'm looking forward to our next match!

[Hyun]Hyun is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.
	What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?
[Hyun]Hyun, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.
[Hyun]Hyun announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	You'll have to compete with me!
[Hyun]Hyun is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?

[Hyun]You find Hyun lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?

	What about just watching?
[Hyun]Hyun caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	You came to see my marvelous moves? I'm flattered. 
[Hyun]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Hyun some orders.
	Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!
[Hyun]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	Stop right there, pig!
[Hyun]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Hyun seems to be worried.
	Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.
[Hyun]Hyun came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?
[Hyun]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...It's about to go down...! Where's the popcorn?

	Who could've done such a hideous thing?
[Hyun]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Hyun seems to be sick of this.
	Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Hyun!

	Come on, I'll show you the best spots around!

[Iggy]Iggy is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell her?
	Teamwork is what matters the most.
[Iggy]Iggy is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I have very specific standards for personality, looks, values, and background. Are you interested in hearing about it?
[Iggy]Iggy seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
	I would like to hear what you think is the best team in the universe.
[Iggy]Iggy is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing any problems.
	That team is far from your style.
[Iggy]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some advice.
	Is winning really worth going that far?
[Iggy]Iggy is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.
	I..Respect your naming taste...
[Iggy]Iggy is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to her.
	A mysterious villain...Bad taste, if you ask me.
[Iggy]Iggy is making a scene. She'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.
	Vicious? More like ugly.
[Iggy]Iggy is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.
	Passes that you prefer aren't always the right answer.
[Iggy]Iggy is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to her?
	If you're up for suggestions, I'm all ears.
[Iggy]It's before the 2nd half, and Iggy is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.
	We should at least put up a fight so they remember us.
[Iggy]You forgot to lock Iggy and almost used her as training material! She looks very upset!
	It was all just to motivate you to become a better player!
[Iggy]Iggy is confused that she won the MVP. What should you tell her?
	Aren't you satisfied with your performance?
[Iggy]Iggy is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	I would've tried to find something that fits me.
[Iggy]The team is saying bad things about Iggy for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
	Skipping practice isn't something that's in her dictionary.
[Iggy]Iggy is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	Hmm...If only I could change the shape of the horns and the color of the scales. That'd be perfect.
[Iggy]Iggy seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to her. 
	Everybody should grow up.
[Iggy]On a day off, Iggy is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
	It's really hard to find the right person.
[Iggy]Iggy is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I want my dreams to come true.)
[Iggy]There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?
	What's done is done. Let's come up with a new design.

[Iggy]Iggy seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.
	It's just a myth. Forget about it.
[Iggy]With a serious face, Iggy is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.
	Well, I'm sure we'll get an answer when we get to the end of this.
[Iggy]Iggy came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	Let's work up a solution.
[Iggy]Iggy is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.
	They support us from the shadows.
[Iggy]The team is having a good run and Iggy is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.
[Iggy]Iggy seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.
[Iggy]Iggy seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.
	Maybe if you increase your Strength...
[Iggy]Iggy is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.
	Flawless skills.
[Iggy]Iggy is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	It's surprising to see such advanced technology.
[Iggy]Iggy plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	We'll see about it after the League.
[Iggy]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Iggy and talk about what to do.
	Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.
[Iggy]Iggy seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.
	I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.
[Iggy]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!
[Iggy]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	I guess he's happy this is a good match.
[Iggy]Iggy's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?
	If you keep it up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.
[Iggy]During a match, Iggy bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?
	We have to keep on going.
[Iggy]Iggy is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.
	Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.
[Iggy]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.
[Iggy]Iggy is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.
[Iggy]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Iggy is starting to get intimidated.
	This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.

[Irin]Irin is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell her?
	To win all the way, of course.
[Irin]Irin is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.
[Irin]Irin seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
	(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)
[Irin]Irin is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing any problems.
	You're right. This is a waste of time.
[Irin]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some advice.
	I don't see anything wrong as long as you can get away with it.
[Irin]Irin is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.
	Cool! Keep it up!
[Irin]Irin is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to her.
	It's silly of you to worry about such things. Are you feeling okay?
[Irin]Irin is making a scene. She'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.
	The door's over there.
[Irin]Irin is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.
	It can't be perfect every time.
[Irin]Irin is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to her?
	How about we play baseball today?
[Irin]It's before the 2nd half, and Irin is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.
	There's nothing we can really do. Let's just get this over with.
[Irin]You forgot to lock Irin and almost used her as training material! She looks very upset!
	It's your fault.
[Irin]Irin is confused that she won the MVP. What should you tell her?
	Nicely done! We're throwing a party today!
[Irin]Irin is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	Something full of excitement!
[Irin]The team is saying bad things about Irin for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
	Her love towards soccer is real.
[Irin]Irin is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	I want one of those. It'll be fun to have a pet dragon.
[Irin]Irin seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to her. 
	It'll be alright. Don't worry.
[Irin]On a day off, Irin is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
	If you find a handsome man, try talking to him!
[Irin]Irin is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I want every day to be exciting and fun.)
[Irin]There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?
	It's finally time for some festival-soccer!

	It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.
[Irin]Irin falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?
	Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.

	I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
[Irre]Irre is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.
	Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
[Irre]Irre isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.

	Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.

	All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.

	This doesn't look good...Can anybody give him some heals?

	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...

	She's truly a role model to us all with her skills and attitude.
[Isillia]You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?

	It's my fault.
[Jacob]Jacob is confused that he won the MVP. What should you tell him?
	You deserve it. Well done!
[Jacob]Jacob is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.

	They support us from the shadows.
[Jacob]The team is having a good run and Jacob is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.

	Maybe if you increase your Strength...

[Jay]Jay is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell her?
	To win all the way, of course.
[Jay]Jay is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.
[Jay]Jay seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
	(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)

[Jay]Jay is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	I want one of those. It'll be fun to have a pet dragon.
[Jay]Jay seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to her.

	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Jeunese]Jeunese picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[Jeunese]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Jeunese]Jeunese is irritated because his opponent has the attribute advantage over him.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[Jeunese]Jeunese thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[Jeunese]Jeunese says he's the center of the team and asks if you agree with him. How should we answer?
	Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.
[Jeunese]Jeunese asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give him a sincere answer.
	I'm going to make a joke before I start crying!
[Jeunese]Jeunese is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.
	Do you think they'll be tasty?
[Jeunese]Jeunese looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to him?
	Do you think any of those comets are populated?
[Jeunese]Jeunese says he's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give him an answer.
	Teach them how adults play soccer.
[Jeunese]Jeunese wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give him an answer.
	Beginner level monsters in an RPG game.
[Jeunese]Jeunese is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to him.
	That's deep. I think it's cool.
[Jeunese]Jeunese says he was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.
[Jeunese]Jeunese says that Bell seemed depressed when he told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry.
[Jeunese]Jeunese seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell him?
	Don't forget that we exist! Haha!
[Jeunese]Jeunese is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?
	Please don't forget about the match.
[Jeunese]Jeunese says he's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.
	Is her name really Kiki?
[Jeunese]Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Jeunese seems to be troubled. What should we do?
	If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?
[Jeunese]Jeunese is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.
[Jeunese]Jeunese went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	We should think about how to make fun of him when he comes back.
[Jeunese]Jeunese claims he saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	Maybe Sophie is actually a male...?
[Jeunese]Jeunese seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?
[Jeunese]Jeunese says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.
[Jeunese]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Jeunese hands you a present.
	(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)
[Jeunese]Jeunese says that he thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give him an answer.
	Maybe she's up to something.

[Jheet]Jheet is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give him an answer.
	We need a decent level of personal performance.
[Jheet]Jheet, who is determined to make everything in his life, even his dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've never dreamt about soccer.
[Jheet]Jheet announces that he will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give him an answer.
	I have faith in you.
[Jheet]Jheet is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to him?
	That doesn't change what we must do.
[Jheet]Jheet wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. He wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to him.
	Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
[Jheet]It seems that Jheet is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Jheet? Nah, he never gets lost.
[Jheet]You find Jheet lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[Jheet]Jheet says he doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. He thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
[Jheet]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[Jheet]Jheet wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
[Jheet]Jheet caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[Jheet]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Jheet some orders.
	Let's try out some forward passes.
[Jheet]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	It's time we use him as training material.
[Jheet]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Jheet seems to be worried.
	It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.
[Jheet]Jheet came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I hope that wasn't all you got.
[Jheet]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...We should get out of here.
[Jheet]Jheet is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer him up?
	It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
[Jheet]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Jheet seems to be sick of this.
	Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
[Jheet]Jheet looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	It's space. Anything can exist here.
[Jheet]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Jheet to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

[Jheet]Jheet seems to be lost after having a good match while his fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to him.
	Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.
[Jheet]With a serious face, Jheet is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give him an answer.
	Being together is enough for me.
[Jheet]Jheet came to you after the match, and says he's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.
[Jheet]Jheet is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.
	Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?
[Jheet]The team is having a good run and Jheet is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	Let's keep this momentum going!
[Jheet]Jheet seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	Let's open up a bright future with this ball.
[Jheet]Jheet seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.
	Don't be weak.
[Jheet]Jheet is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.
	Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.
[Jheet]Jheet is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.
[Jheet]Jheet plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.
	I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.
[Jheet]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Jheet and talk about what to do.
	We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.
[Jheet]Jheet seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.
	I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great. 
[Jheet]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	...Uh...So no soccer?
[Jheet]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!
[Jheet]Jheet's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next match. What should we say to him?
	Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.
[Jheet]During a match, Jheet bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?
	It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.
[Jheet]Jheet is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to him.
	It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.
[Jheet]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.
[Jheet]Jheet is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.
[Jheet]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Jheet is starting to get intimidated.
	Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.

[Jibril]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Jibril asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	What, are you expecting something like ''I feel like I can fly'' or something?
[Jibril]Jibril suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.
[Jibril]Jibril is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.
	(Just nod your head.)
[Jibril]Jibril has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.
	You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.
[Jibril]As Jibril said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.
	I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.
[Jibril]The crowd is cheering for Jibril. Jibril seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.
	How about just accepting the compliments for today?
[Jibril]Jibril is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.
	The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.
[Jibril]Jibril was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.
	It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!
[Jibril]The team will not have a match for some time. Jibril asks you about your plan.
	I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.
[Jibril]It's a very intense match and Jibril falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Jibril up and the two exchange smiles.
	Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?
[Jibril]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.
[Jibril]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Jibril having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	...I see two idiots standing in front of me...
[Jibril]Jibril is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.
	I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.
[Jibril]Jibril scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!
	That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!
[Jibril]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Jibril.
	He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.
[Jibril]Jibril falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?
	If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.
[Jibril]Jibril lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...
[Jibril]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Jibril. Let's talk to her.
	(Ignore.)
[Jibril]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Jibril is curious and wants to take a look.
	We should probably ignore them and just walk by.
[Jibril]Jibril brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	Throw it away. NOW.

[Jibril]You come across Jibril, who was overwhelmed by her opponent throughout the game. Let's cheer her up.
	Those scumbags played dirty. Ugh, I'm angry!
[Jibril]Jibril is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.
	I'm not comfortable with this conversation.
[Jibril]Jibril, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal who you really are. What should we answer?
	To bring justice with soccer. That's all.
[Jibril]Jibril says to you that it was an honor to be able to play with you. Let's give her an answer.
	Let's do our best until the very end!
[Jibril]You're having a conversation with Jibril about the power of Spirit Stones which is covered in secrets. Let's tell her what you think.
	I won't rely on Spirit Stones.
[Jibril]Jibril is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''
	I like what you just said.
[Jibril]Let's talk to Jibril who recently started to take interest in the world of angels.
	It's a place to rest for the good.
[Jibril]Jibril is asking you if you ever saw the World Tree. Let's tell her your thoughts.
	It's something I'd want to see again with a person I care.
[Jibril]The teammates are speaking highly of Jibril, saying she's a good role model. Let's add in.
	She's truly a role model to us all with her skills and attitude.
[Jibril]You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?
	I feel sorry, but that's irrelevant to the match.
[Jibril]Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Jibril wants to say a word.
	Come on guys, you know it's an exciting thing to be playing against a strong team! Keep your heads up high!
[Jibril]You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.
	So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.
[Jibril]Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?
	We will confront them fair and square, and win.
[Jibril]The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?
	Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?
[Jibril]Jibril points out that the time the men of Minerva died and the time the epidemic broke out in Metro City matches.
	That's too convenient to be a coincidence.
[Jibril]Mortor and Wizol of the Peacemakers are helping an old man. Jibril seems to be surprised.
	Well, what do you know! They have some decency in them after all.
[Jibril]A big fight broke out between an angel and a demon within the team. Jibril is asking for help.
	I hope the demon didn't say anything stupid.
[Jibril]Cracsus threatens to hack Jibril's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?
	Don't fall for this cheap shot.
[Jibril]Jibril is thinking about what Selena said about saving the galaxy if we win the Galaxy League.
	Then we should do our very best to win.
[Jibril]Jibril is thinking about what the Universe of Oblivion is.
	I don't like the word oblivion.

[Jiho]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Jiho asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	What, are you expecting something like ''I feel like I can fly'' or something?
[Jiho]Jiho suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.

	Let's work up a solution.

	There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.

[Jiho]Jiho seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.
	Maybe if you increase your Strength...
[Jiho]Jiho is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.
	Flawless skills.
[Jiho]Jiho is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	It's surprising to see such advanced technology.
[Jiho]Jiho plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.

	I guess he's happy this is a good match.

	Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.

	All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.
[Jiho]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Jiho is starting to get intimidated.

[Jiho]Jiho is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.
	It's a result of team effort.
[Jiho]After a meeting, Jiho's eyes met yours a several times and Jiho asks if she has something on her face.
	I was just thinking about how much you do for the team.
[Jiho]With a serious look on her face, Jiho warns you to go to the bathroom before the match.
	Bathroom...It is indeed a very important matter...
[Jiho]Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Jiho on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?
	I can't pick just one...

	Makes it worth the challenge, don't you think so?

[Jiho]It's Jiho's birthday. Let's give her a present.

[Jiho]You see Jiho's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Jiho. What should we do?
	Let's see how long they last. Come on guys!
[Jiho]The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?
	I guess I can go to the soccer gear shop.
[Jiho]You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also Jiho's rival, has been severely injured and is in the hospital. What should you say to her?
	Sorry for the bad news. Do you want to pay a visit?

	There will always be a place for you to return.
[Jiho]Jiho is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with Jiho.
	We can overcome this with team effort.
[Jiho]Jiho is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.
	I'm sure there were multiple reasons on why the kingdom fell. It's sad to hear such stories.
[Jiho]You got a couple of tickets to Veronica's live concert. Jiho seems to be interested.
	We're going to make it fair and gather everybody around so we can draw for the ticket.

	Jiho? Nah, she never gets lost.
[Jiho]You find Jiho lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[Jiho]Jiho says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.

	That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
[Jiho]Jiho caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?

	It's time we use him as training material.
[Jiho]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Jiho seems to be worried.
	It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.
[Jiho]Jiho came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I hope that wasn't all you got.
[Jiho]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...We should get out of here.

[Jiho]Jiho looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	It's space. Anything can exist here.
[Jiho]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Jiho to set some simple rules.

	(I want every day to be exciting and fun.)

	The opponents are mesmerized by the beauty of our players.
[Jin]After a meeting, Jin's eyes met yours a several times and Jin asks if he has something on his face.
	Yeah, Kuma's hat...
[Jin]With a serious look on his face, Jin warns you to go to the bathroom before the match.
	Why does an ordinary advice sound so strange...
[Jin]Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Jin on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?

	Manga, anime, and figures...! Here I come!

	I think we should come up with an action speed deck or go for counterattacks...

	We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.
[Jin]Jin seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.
	I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great.

[Kalkrish]Kalkrish looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Don't worry. Leave it up to me.
[Kalkrish]Kalkrish's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Kalkrish seems to be nervous. Let's talk to him.
	You're doing fine. Don't play your opponent's game.
[Kalkrish]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Kalkrish.
	I think he felt better because of the positive energy you always have around you.
[Kalkrish]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.
[Kalkrish]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Kalkrish and his opponent isn't over yet.
	I've never seen him worked up that much.
[Kalkrish]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Kalkrish do?
	(Give him instructions so that he can do his share of the cleaning quickly.)
[Kalkrish]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	We didn't play dirty, right?
[Kalkrish]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Kalkrish. What should you say?
	I hope you two become good rivals.
[Kalkrish]Kalkrish is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Don't worry about me! Do your job!
[Kalkrish]Latios is chatting with Kalkrish after the match. Let's barge in.
	Kalkrish was fantastic on the field, right?

[Karuru]Karuru is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.
	Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.
[Karuru]Karuru is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?
	It's the place of dreams colliding.
[Karuru]Karuru wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	Why don't you join them and find out?
[Karuru]Karuru is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.
	Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!
[Karuru]Karuru is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.
	Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!
[Karuru]Karuru is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.
	My fans!
[Karuru]This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?
	Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.
[Karuru]Karuru says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	He'll remember someday.
[Karuru]The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.
	Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!
[Karuru]Karuru seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.
[Karuru]Ogre's pony tail slapped Karuru in the face!
	That must hurt.
[Karuru]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
[Karuru]Karuru is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.
	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[Karuru]Karuru says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[Karuru]Karuru says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[Karuru]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Karuru]Karuru picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[Karuru]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Karuru]Karuru is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[Karuru]Karuru thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[Karuru]Karuru is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.
	What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?
[Karuru]Karuru, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.
[Karuru]Karuru announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	You'll have to compete with me!
[Karuru]Karuru is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
	Come on, cheer up. You're not being yourself.
[Karuru]Karuru wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
	It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.
[Karuru]It seems that Karuru is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Listen carefully and you'll find her.
[Karuru]You find Karuru lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!
[Karuru]Karuru says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Hmm? That is odd...What do you think about this?
[Karuru]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!
[Karuru]Karuru wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	What about just watching?
[Karuru]Karuru caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	You came to see my marvelous moves? I'm flattered. 
[Karuru]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Karuru some orders.
	Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!
[Karuru]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	Stop right there, pig!
[Karuru]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Karuru seems to be worried.
	Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.
[Karuru]Karuru came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?
[Karuru]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...It's about to go down...! Where's the popcorn?
[Karuru]Karuru is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	Who could've done such a hideous thing?
[Karuru]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Karuru seems to be sick of this.
	Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Karuru!
[Karuru]Karuru looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	How about we ask Jeunese?
[Karuru]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Karuru to set some simple rules.
	Come on, I'll show you the best spots around!

[Kei]Kei is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.
	It's all thanks to you.
[Kei]After a meeting, Kei's eyes met yours a several times and Kei asks if he has something on his face.
	I was just thinking the team became stronger, thanks to you.
[Kei]With a serious look on his face, Kei warns you to go to the bathroom before the match.
	I'm surprised you said that. I won't ask what happened to you.
[Kei]Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Kei on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?
	You and I are already perfect. So I guess that means we shouldn't be saying our names.
[Kei]Kei is worried that he has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous things. What should we tell him?
	You're the most dangerous of them all.
[Kei]Kei is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to him.
	Let's go tell the manager.

	I think that may be you.
[Kei]You find Kei being very excited after performing an awesome play. How will you react?
	Nice play! Fantastic!
[Kei]Kei is having trouble focusing on the match. Let's help him out.
	Just calm down a bit. You got this.
[Kei]Kei is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.
	He's just material for leveling up.
[Kei]Kei doesn't like the new team advertisement video.
	It didn't portray your awesome performance.
[Kei]It's Kei's birthday. Let's give him a present.
	This is a championship trophy replica for you. The designs are inspired by you.
[Kei]You see Kei's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Kei. What should we do?
	He is probably not even listening...
[Kei]The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?
	It's time for some good food.
[Kei]You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also Kei's rival, has been severely injured and is in the hospital. What should you say to him?
	This won't be the end of your rival. 
[Kei]Kei comes to you and says that he has to leave the team because of personal reasons. What should we say?
	Well, I don't want to be the one holding you back. Good luck!
[Kei]Kei is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with Kei.
	I'll try to have the ball come your way.
[Kei]Kei is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.
	Pathetic...That is no king.
[Kei]You got a couple of tickets to Veronica's live concert. Kei seems to be interested.
	These are for you, of course. Here.
[Kei]Kei says he wants to cry because the goal keeper on the other team just won't go down no matter how many shots he makes.
	Let's come up with a new strategy to give you more synergy.

[Kei]Kei is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give him an answer.
	Wreck the other team.
[Kei]Kei, who is determined to make everything in his life, even his dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	It was an intense feeling as if I was going against the strongest team in the universe.
[Kei]Kei announces that he will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give him an answer.
	I feel bad for the players that have to face you.
[Kei]Kei is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to him?
	Stop whining. I like it better when you're arrogant and sarcastic.
[Kei]Kei wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. He wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to him.
	I'm surprised you care so much for your friends.
[Kei]It seems that Kei is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Let's ask Khirel to find him...
[Kei]You find Kei lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hmm, I guess you're more domestic than I thought.
[Kei]Kei says he doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. He thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	I think you two have something in common...
[Kei]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	Don't kill him, okay?
[Kei]Kei wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	Sure. Let's beat them all and take the prize money!
[Kei]Kei caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	I think we should hang him.
[Kei]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Kei some orders.
	Make him know who he's up against.
[Kei]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!
[Kei]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Kei seems to be worried.
	Weakling. Should've been rougher on that player.
[Kei]Kei came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I'm sure you got scammed.
[Kei]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	James and Bora...Who's the villain? 
[Kei]Kei is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer him up?
	We'll find the ones that did this and use them as fertilizers.
[Kei]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Kei seems to be sick of this.
	Iron Claw!
[Kei]Kei looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.
[Kei]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Kei to set some simple rules.
	This team is a mess. Gather everybody on the field. I'll knock that spirit back into you guys if I have to.

[Kevin]Kevin is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give him an answer.
	We need a decent level of personal performance.
[Kevin]Kevin, who is determined to make everything in his life, even his dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.

[Kevin]Kevin looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	It's space. Anything can exist here.
[Kevin]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Kevin to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

[Kevin]Kevin is asking you what you think is it that makes this team great. You weren't expecting this, but you should give him an answer.
	We have a strong lineup of players that make our star players shine brighter.
[Kevin]Kevin is angry because he was criticized by his performance and is asking your opinion. Let's give him an answer.
	I admit it. You're the best in the team.

	You're as good as they are, I'd say you deserve more credit.
[Kevin]Kevin is furious about how Lucian is always surrounded by girls. What should we say?
	He's popular, just not as much as me.
[Kevin]Kirin suddenly appears, pats Kevin on the head while teasing him, and then goes away. Kevin seems angry...
	Patting you on the head? He must not fear for his life!

[Khirel]Khirel is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell him?
	Best of 4 should be our goal.
[Khirel]Khirel is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I think that being able to understand each other is the most important.
[Khirel]Khirel seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. He seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
	It's within our grasp.

	The honor of our opponent is also important.
[Khirel]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give him some advice.
	Be true to yourself.
[Khirel]Khirel is having trouble deciding a name for his special move. His options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.
	I'm sure you're going to become an intergalactic fool.
[Khirel]Khirel is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to him.
	We must have faith in the Gate Keepers and win the Galaxy League.

	It's my fault.
[Khirel]Khirel is confused that he won the MVP. What should you tell him?
	You deserve it. Well done!
[Khirel]Khirel is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	I would've been doing something to save the universe.
[Khirel]The team is saying bad things about Khirel for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
	Do you really think that he would skip practice?
[Khirel]Khirel is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	I can feel the strength of that majestic creature.

	Let's split up and find the uniforms.

	I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.
[Khirel]Khirel is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.
	Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?
[Khirel]The team is having a good run and Khirel is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	Let's keep this momentum going!
[Khirel]Khirel seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	Let's open up a bright future with this ball.
[Khirel]Khirel seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.
	Don't be weak.
[Khirel]Khirel is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.
	Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.
[Khirel]Khirel is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.
[Khirel]Khirel plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.
	I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.
[Khirel]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Khirel and talk about what to do.
	We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.
[Khirel]Khirel seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.
	I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great. 
[Khirel]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	...Uh...So no soccer?
[Khirel]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!
[Khirel]Khirel's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next match. What should we say to him?
	Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.

[Khirel]Khirel is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to him.
	It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.

	I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.
[Khirel]Khirel is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.
[Khirel]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Khirel is starting to get intimidated.
	Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.

[Kiki]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Kiki asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	Wow. I'm sooooo happy.
[Kiki]Kiki suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.
[Kiki]Kiki is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.
	(Pat her on the head.)
[Kiki]Kiki has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.
	I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.
[Kiki]As Kiki said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.
	I'm sure it's going in a good direction.
[Kiki]The crowd is cheering for Kiki. Kiki seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.
	They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.
[Kiki]Kiki is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.
	I am so thankful to them.
[Kiki]Kiki was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.
	Oh, that'll be so cute!
[Kiki]The team will not have a match for some time. Kiki asks you about your plan.
	Hmm, wanna go shopping?
[Kiki]It's a very intense match and Kiki falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Kiki up and the two exchange smiles.
	That player must have a heart of gold.
[Kiki]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
[Kiki]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Kiki having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?
[Kiki]Kiki is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.
	Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.
[Kiki]Kiki scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!
	Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?

	It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.
[Kiki]Kiki falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?
	Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.

	This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?
[Kiki]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Kiki. Let's talk to her.

[Kiki]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Kiki is curious and wants to take a look.
	They must love volunteer work!

[Kiki]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Can't you cook ramen by yourself?
[Kiki]You're watching the storm with Kiki and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.

	Littre will be fine.
[Kiki]Kiki's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Kiki seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	That player is just messing with you.
[Kiki]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Kiki.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Kiki]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's give them a hand.
[Kiki]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Kiki and her opponent isn't over yet.
	You better win that fight!
[Kiki]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Kiki do?
	(Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)
[Kiki]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	They will never learn with an attitude like that.
[Kiki]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Kiki. What should you say?
	Well, Kiki does have that kind of charm.
[Kiki]Kiki is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Can you peel this guy off of me?
[Kiki]Latios is chatting with Kiki after the match. Let's barge in.
	I'm looking forward to our next match!

[Kirin]Kirin is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to him.
	Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.
[Kirin]Kirin is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help him?
	It's the place of dreams colliding.
[Kirin]Kirin wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	Why don't you join them and find out?
[Kirin]Kirin is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became his life. Let's talk with him.
	Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!
[Kirin]Kirin is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give him an opinion.
	Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!
[Kirin]Kirin is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.

	Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.
[Kirin]Kirin says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.

[Kirin]Ogre's pony tail slapped Kirin in the face!

[Kirin]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?

[Kirin]Kirin is suddenly showing massive improvement in his performance. He must've learned something during a match.
	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[Kirin]Kirin says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[Kirin]Kirin says he forgot to use his skill points before entering the match. What should we say to him?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[Kirin]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Kirin]Kirin picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[Kirin]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Kirin]Kirin is irritated because his opponent has the attribute advantage over him.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[Kirin]Kirin thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[Kirin]Kirin says he's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give him an answer.

[Kirin]Kirin wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give him an answer.

	That's deep. I think it's cool.
[Kirin]Kirin says he was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.
[Kirin]Kirin says that Bell seemed depressed when he told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry.
[Kirin]Kirin seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell him?

	It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.
[Kirin]Kirin went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	We should think about how to make fun of him when he comes back.
[Kirin]Kirin claims he saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	Maybe Sophie is actually a male...?
[Kirin]Kirin seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?
[Kirin]Kirin says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.
[Kirin]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Kirin hands you a present.
	(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)
[Kirin]Kirin says that he thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give him an answer.

[Kirna]Kirna seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.
	Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.
[Kirna]With a serious face, Kirna is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.
	Being together is enough for me.
[Kirna]Kirna came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.
[Kirna]Kirna is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.
	Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?
[Kirna]The team is having a good run and Kirna is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	Let's keep this momentum going!
[Kirna]Kirna seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	Let's open up a bright future with this ball.
[Kirna]Kirna seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.
	Don't be weak.
[Kirna]Kirna is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.
	Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.
[Kirna]Kirna is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.
[Kirna]Kirna plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.
[Kirna]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Kirna and talk about what to do.
	We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.
[Kirna]Kirna seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.
	I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great. 
[Kirna]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	...Uh...So no soccer?
[Kirna]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?

	I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.
[Kirna]Kirna is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.
[Kirna]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Kirna is starting to get intimidated.
	Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.

	Get yourselves together, guys. Are you going to give up already?

	It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.

	Pathetic. We'll show them that we're better in many ways.

	Well, I don't want to be the one holding you back. Good luck!

	You can overcome this like always. Right?
[Leonard]Leonard seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to him.
	I'm starting to see true strength in this team.
[Leonard]You come across Leonard who is limping. He says it's nothing. What should we do?
	Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.
[Leonard]You visit Merlin's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Can't you cook ramen by yourself?
[Leonard]You're watching the storm with Leonard and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.

	Littre will be fine.
[Leonard]Leonard's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Leonard seems to be nervous. Let's talk to him.
	That player is just messing with you.
[Leonard]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Leonard.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Leonard]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's give them a hand.

	You better win that fight!
[Leonard]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Leonard do?
	(Let him take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)

	I think they're also mesmerized by you. You have a charm that matches a demon...
[Lilith]Being too excited, Lilith is overreacting while talking about the game. It seems she wants people to agree with her.
	Yeah. The sight of you running on the field was marvelous.
[Lilith]Lilith is asking what it would be like to date an alien. Give her your opinion.
	I believe it'll be romantic.
[Lilith]Lilith seems to be planning to enter for the Galaxy League Mascot Contest. Let's talk to her.
	Mascot? More like a super model. You're too good looking to be a mere mascot.
[Lilith]Lilith asks what your plans are for the holidays when there's no training or match. Give her an answer.
	(Meet up with my lover.)

	Didn't she grow up being friends with the princess? I think I know what's going on...

	(It won't be long until the opponent becomes mesmerized by Lilith's charms.)

	Yeah, she's as charming as you!
[Lilith]The team became furious after seeing Lilith fall by the focused attack of the opposing team and used that fury to win the game. Let's say something.
	Your beauty is a curse...
[Lilith]Lilith is having trouble finding a Spirit Stone that fits her needs and taste. Let's give her advice.
	How about Metatron's Will? It's cute with the butterfly decorations.

	Don't get greedy and go for all of the men.

	You're right. This is a waste of time.

[Lindberg]Lindberg seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.
[Lindberg]Ogre's pony tail slapped Lindberg in the face!
	That must hurt.
[Lindberg]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
[Lindberg]Lindberg is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.
	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[Lindberg]Lindberg says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[Lindberg]Lindberg says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[Lindberg]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Lindberg]Lindberg picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[Lindberg]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Lindberg]Lindberg is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.

	I'm starting to see true strength in this team.
[Lindberg]You come across Lindberg who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?
	Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.
[Lindberg]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Can't you cook ramen by yourself?
[Lindberg]You're watching the storm with Lindberg and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.

	Littre will be fine.
[Lindberg]Lindberg's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Lindberg seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	That player is just messing with you.
[Lindberg]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Lindberg.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Lindberg]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's give them a hand.
[Lindberg]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Lindberg and her opponent isn't over yet.
	You better win that fight!
[Lindberg]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Lindberg do?
	(Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)
[Lindberg]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	They will never learn with an attitude like that.
[Lindberg]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Lindberg. What should you say?
	Well, Lindberg does have that kind of charm.
[Lindberg]Lindberg is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Can you peel this guy off of me?
[Lindberg]Latios is chatting with Lindberg after the match. Let's barge in.

	I want to practice with you, if that's okay with you. No?

	Yeah? Well, I did what I did for you.
[Lindsey]Lindsey wants to have an academic conversation about the 5th dimension, string theory, and other infamously hard space theories. Why...?

	Well, Loyce does have that kind of charm.
[Loyce]Loyce is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?

	That's deep. I think it's cool.

[Lucian]Lucian is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.
[Lucian]Lucian went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	We should think about how to make fun of him when he comes back.
[Lucian]Lucian claims he saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	Maybe Sophie is actually a male...?
[Lucian]Lucian seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?
[Lucian]Lucian says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.
[Lucian]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Lucian hands you a present.
	(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)
[Lucian]Lucian says that he thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give him an answer.

[Lucian]Lucian is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.
	I'm not comfortable with this conversation.

	To bring justice with soccer. That's all.
[Lucian]Lucian says to you that it was an honor to be able to play with you. Let's give him an answer.
	Let's do our best until the very end!
[Lucian]You're having a conversation with Lucian about the power of Spirit Stones which is covered in secrets. Let's tell him what you think.

	It's something I'd want to see again with a person I care.
[Lucian]The teammates are speaking highly of Lucian, saying he's a good role model. Let's add in.
	He's truly a role model to us all with his skills and attitude.
[Lucian]You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?
	I feel sorry, but that's irrelevant to the match.
[Lucian]Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Lucian wants to say a word.
	Come on guys, you know it's an exciting thing to be playing against a strong team! Keep your heads up high!
[Lucian]You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.
	So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.
[Lucian]Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?
	We will confront them fair and square, and win.
[Lucian]The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?
	Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?
[Lucian]Lucian points out that the time the men of Minerva died and the time the epidemic broke out in Metro City matches.
	That's too convenient to be a coincidence.

	Well, what do you know! They have some decency in them after all.
[Lucian]A big fight broke out between an angel and a demon within the team. Lucian is asking for help.
	I hope the demon didn't say anything stupid.
[Lucian]Cracsus threatens to hack Lucian's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?

[Lucian]Lucian is thinking about what Selena said about saving the galaxy if we win the Galaxy League.
	Then we should do our very best to win.
[Lucian]Lucian is thinking about what the Universe of Oblivion is.

	I'm starting to see true strength in this team.

[Lucid]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Can't you cook ramen by yourself?

	Littre will be fine.
[Lucid]Lucid's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Lucid seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	That player is just messing with you.
[Lucid]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Lucid.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Lucid]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's give them a hand.
[Lucid]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Lucid and her opponent isn't over yet.
	You better win that fight!
[Lucid]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Lucid do?
	(Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)

[Lucid]Lucid asks what you think is the most important ability in soccer. Give her an answer.
	Excitement and elegance. The fans love it.
[Lucid]Lucid is criticizing the male teammates that were mesmerized by Lilith during the match. It's your job to defend your teammates.
	I think they're also mesmerized by you. You have a charm that matches a demon...
[Lucid]Being too excited, Lucid is overreacting while talking about the game. It seems she wants people to agree with her.
	Yeah. The sight of you running on the field was marvelous.

	(It won't be long until the opponent becomes mesmerized by Lucid's charms.)

	We need a decent level of personal performance.

[Lucifer]You find Lucifer lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[Lucifer]Lucifer says he doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. He thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.

	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[Lucifer]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Lucifer some orders.
	Let's try out some forward passes.
[Lucifer]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	It's time we use him as training material.
[Lucifer]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Lucifer seems to be worried.

	Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
[Lucifer]Lucifer looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	It's space. Anything can exist here.
[Lucifer]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Lucifer to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

	They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.
[Lucifer]With a serious face, Lucifer is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give him an answer.

[Lucifer]Lucifer is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.
	Well, having a good ace skill is a start.

	Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.
[Lucifer]Lucifer plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.
	I'm thinking of opening a shop.

	I hope they have a ''Continue'' button around here.

[Lucius]Lucius is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell him?
	Best of 4 should be our goal.
[Lucius]Lucius is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I think that being able to understand each other is the most important.
[Lucius]Lucius seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. He seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
	It's within our grasp.
[Lucius]Lucius is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop him from causing any problems.
	The honor of our opponent is also important.
[Lucius]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give him some advice.
	Be true to yourself.
[Lucius]Lucius is having trouble deciding a name for his special move. His options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.
	I'm sure you're going to become an intergalactic fool.
[Lucius]Lucius is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to him.
	We must have faith in the Gate Keepers and win the Galaxy League.

	This needs to be analyzed and fixed. Can you help me?

	It's my fault.
[Lucius]Lucius is confused that he won the MVP. What should you tell him?
	You deserve it. Well done!
[Lucius]Lucius is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	I would've been doing something to save the universe.
[Lucius]The team is saying bad things about Lucius for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
	Do you really think that he would skip practice?
[Lucius]Lucius is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	I can feel the strength of that majestic creature.

[Lucius]On a day off, Lucius is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
	I'd love to have a stable job first.
[Lucius]Lucius is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I just don't want to waste a single day in my life.)

[Lulu]It's a very intense match and Lulu falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Lulu up and the two exchange smiles.
	That player must have a heart of gold.
[Lulu]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
[Lulu]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Lulu having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?

	Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.
[Lulu]Lulu scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!
	Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?
[Lulu]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Lulu.
	It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.
[Lulu]Lulu falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?

[Lynia]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Lynia. What should you say?
	Well, Lynia does have that kind of charm.
[Lynia]Lynia is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Can you peel this guy off of me?
[Lynia]Latios is chatting with Lynia after the match. Let's barge in.
	I'm looking forward to our next match!

[Lynia]Lynia is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.
	We need a decent level of personal performance.
[Lynia]Lynia, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've never dreamt about soccer.
[Lynia]Lynia announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	I have faith in you.
[Lynia]Lynia is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
	That doesn't change what we must do.
[Lynia]Lynia wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
	Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
[Lynia]It seems that Lynia is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Lynia? Nah, she never gets lost.
[Lynia]You find Lynia lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[Lynia]Lynia says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
[Lynia]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[Lynia]Lynia wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
[Lynia]Lynia caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[Lynia]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Lynia some orders.
	Let's try out some forward passes.
[Lynia]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	It's time we use him as training material.
[Lynia]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Lynia seems to be worried.
	It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.
[Lynia]Lynia came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I hope that wasn't all you got.
[Lynia]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...We should get out of here.
[Lynia]Lynia is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
[Lynia]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Lynia seems to be sick of this.
	Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
[Lynia]Lynia looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	It's space. Anything can exist here.
[Lynia]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Lynia to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

[MP Dane]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Dane asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!
[MP Dane]Dane suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!
[MP Dane]Dane is saying that his teammates are what keeps him going.
	(Put your thumbs up, wink, and send a juicy smile.)
[MP Dane]Dane has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. He is asking for your evaluation on his plays. Let's give him an answer.
	Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it. You should keep that going.
[MP Dane]As Dane said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to him.
	It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.
[MP Dane]The crowd is cheering for Dane. Dane seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help him out.
	They're all in love with your enthusiastic play.
[MP Dane]Dane is impressed by the help he received from the elementals. Let's talk to him.
	I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!
[MP Dane]Dane was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin himself. Let's talk to him.
	We can play soccer with the penguins!
[MP Dane]The team will not have a match for some time. Dane asks you about your plan.
	We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.
[MP Dane]It's a very intense match and Dane falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Dane up and the two exchange smiles.
	True sportsmanship! Wonderful!
[MP Dane]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.
[MP Dane]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Dane having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	Save the energy for the match.
[MP Dane]Dane is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to him.
	The fans love your performance!
[MP Dane]Dane scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate him!
	You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!
[MP Dane]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Dane.
	I feel like he's mocking us!
[MP Dane]Dane falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to him?
	Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!
[MP Dane]Dane lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	I will avenge you!
[MP Dane]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Dane. Let's talk to her.
	We'll win next time!
[MP Dane]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Dane is curious and wants to take a look.
	Let's go help them!
[MP Dane]Dane brought a drink that he says he received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	Drink it up!

[MP Dane]Dane is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to him.
	We haven't awakened our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyond!
[MP Dane]Dane is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help him?
	It's the place where the chosen ones learn about their destiny.
[MP Dane]Dane wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	All goes as planned...Hmm? Just ignore that.
[MP Dane]Dane is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became his life. Let's talk with him.
	And that's how we walk towards our destiny.
[MP Dane]Dane is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give him an opinion.
	This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!
[MP Dane]Dane is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.
	My friends from previous life...They would be pleased to see me win.
[MP Dane]This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?
	I'm going to check out the new comic issues. Wanna come along?
[MP Dane]Dane says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	Hmm, a revived person that forgot his purpose...Reminds me of somebody.
[MP Dane]The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.
	What a depressing weather...
[MP Dane]Dane seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	That's a dangerous secret you're trying to find out about. Do you still want to know?
[MP Dane]Ogre's pony tail slapped Dane in the face!
	Even his hair is a weapon! Is that even allowed?
[MP Dane]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.
[MP Dane]Dane is suddenly showing massive improvement in his performance. He must've learned something during a match.
	I knew this day would come.
[MP Dane]Dane says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.
[MP Dane]Dane says he forgot to use his skill points before entering the match. What should we say to him?
	You can only find your true potential when you don't rely on your skills!
[MP Dane]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	Fontus...You sure are my archnemesis!
[MP Dane]Dane picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	So, this is how the revelation begins!
[MP Dane]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?
[MP Dane]Dane is irritated because his opponent has the attribute advantage over him.
	It's time, Dane! Awaken the 6th attribute and show your true powers!
[MP Dane]Dane thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	That's because you haven't opened up your ''third eye''!

[MX26 Kumi]Kumi is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.
	It's a result of team effort.
[MX26 Kumi]After a meeting, Kumi's eyes met yours a several times and Kumi asks if she has something on her face.
	I was just thinking about how much you do for the team.
[MX26 Kumi]With a serious look on her face, Kumi warns you to go to the bathroom before the match.
	Bathroom...It is indeed a very important matter...
[MX26 Kumi]Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Kumi on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?
	I can't pick just one...
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi is worried that she has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous things. What should we tell her?
	Makes it worth the challenge, don't you think so?
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to her.
	I want you to form a team and catch every single bear near this locker room.
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi is asking if you have a special person who you would like to share happy moments with. Let's give her an answer.
	Every teammate there by my side on the field is special.
[MX26 Kumi]You find Kumi being very excited after performing an awesome play. How will you react?
	Now we're starting to look like a team!
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi is having trouble focusing on the match. Let's help her out.
	I'll teach you how to meditate to synchronize the breathing with other teammates.
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.
	I like how all of the Gate Keepers have different characteristics.
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi doesn't like the new team advertisement video.
	It didn't have to have the bench warmers in the video.
[MX26 Kumi]It's Kumi's birthday. Let's give her a present.
	Here! I made some cookies with the team.
[MX26 Kumi]You see Kumi's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Kumi. What should we do?
	Let's see how long they last. Come on guys!
[MX26 Kumi]The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?
	I guess I can go to the soccer gear shop.
[MX26 Kumi]You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also Kumi's rival, has been severely injured and is in the hospital. What should you say to her?
	Sorry for the bad news. Do you want to pay a visit?
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi comes to you and says that she has to leave the team because of personal reasons. What should we say?
	There will always be a place for you to return.
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with Kumi.
	We can overcome this with team effort.
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.
	I'm sure there were multiple reasons on why the kingdom fell. It's sad to hear such stories.
[MX26 Kumi]You got a couple of tickets to Veronica's live concert. Kumi seems to be interested.
	We're going to make it fair and gather everybody around so we can draw for the ticket.
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi says she wants to cry because the goal keeper on the other team just won't go down no matter how many shots she makes.
	I'll come up with a formation that can bring the best out of everybody.

[MX26 Kumi]Kumi says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?
	Of course! Everybody is counting on you!
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give her a sincere answer.
	I want to see everybody smile. I think that'll make me happy.
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.
	I'd like to keep one as a pet.
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?
	Where do you think those comets are going?
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.
	Yeah, I mean they could get hurt.
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.
	I'm planning to make a whole line of merchandise with them as the character.
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.
	Life is a light of its own.
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	Just hear them out and smile. They'll feel better.
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	I sense that there's something she hasn't told us yet...
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?
	Congratulations! How did you guys get along?
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?
	You're playing soccer! You're fine!
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi says she's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.
	Tell her to be our lap cat.
[MX26 Kumi]Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Kumi seems to be troubled. What should we do?
	If you guys keep giving Kumi trouble, I swear to god I'll use you both as special training material.
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	She seems like a nice girl.
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	Kumi is in danger! We have to save her!
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	She must've made a mistake.
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	We can do this! Let's go!
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	Yeah, they get along pretty well.
[MX26 Kumi]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Kumi hands you a present.
	(A cute and pretty pendant)
[MX26 Kumi]Kumi says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.
	I think she likes him.

[MX27 Kainen]Kainen is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give him an answer.
	We need a decent level of personal performance.
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen, who is determined to make everything in his life, even his dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've never dreamt about soccer.
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen announces that he will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give him an answer.
	I have faith in you.
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to him?
	That doesn't change what we must do.
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. He wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to him.
	Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
[MX27 Kainen]It seems that Kainen is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Kainen? Nah, he never gets lost.
[MX27 Kainen]You find Kainen lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen says he doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. He thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
[MX27 Kainen]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?

[MX27 Kainen]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Kainen to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

[MX27 Kainen]Kainen is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell him?
	Teamwork is what matters the most.
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I have very specific standards for personality, looks, values, and background. Are you interested in hearing about it?
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. He seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
	I would like to hear what you think is the best team in the universe.
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop him from causing any problems.
	That team is far from your style.
[MX27 Kainen]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give him some advice.
	Is winning really worth going that far?
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen is having trouble deciding a name for his special move. His options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.
	I..Respect your naming taste...
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to him.
	A mysterious villain...Bad taste, if you ask me.
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen is making a scene. He'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.
	Vicious? More like ugly.
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.
	Passes that you prefer aren't always the right answer.
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to him?
	If you're up for suggestions, I'm all ears.
[MX27 Kainen]It's before the 2nd half, and Kainen is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.
	We should at least put up a fight so they remember us.
[MX27 Kainen]You forgot to lock Kainen and almost used him as training material! He looks very upset!
	It was all just to motivate you to become a better player!
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen is confused that he won the MVP. What should you tell him?
	Aren't you satisfied with your performance?
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	I would've tried to find something that fits me.
[MX27 Kainen]The team is saying bad things about Kainen for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
	Skipping practice isn't something that's in his dictionary.
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	Hmm...If only I could change the shape of the horns and the color of the scales. That'd be perfect.
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to him. 
	Everybody should grow up.
[MX27 Kainen]On a day off, Kainen is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
	It's really hard to find the right person.
[MX27 Kainen]Kainen is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I want my dreams to come true.)
[MX27 Kainen]There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?
	What's done is done. Let's come up with a new design.

[MX27 Leventor]Leventor is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give him an answer.

	Leventor? Nah, he never gets lost.
[MX27 Leventor]You find Leventor lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[MX27 Leventor]Leventor says he doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. He thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
[MX27 Leventor]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[MX27 Leventor]Leventor wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?

[MX27 Leventor]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Leventor to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

[MX27 Leventor]Leventor seems to be lost after having a good match while his fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to him.
	It's just a myth. Forget about it.
[MX27 Leventor]With a serious face, Leventor is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give him an answer.
	Well, I'm sure we'll get an answer when we get to the end of this.
[MX27 Leventor]Leventor came to you after the match, and says he's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	Let's work up a solution.
[MX27 Leventor]Leventor is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.
	They support us from the shadows.
[MX27 Leventor]The team is having a good run and Leventor is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.
[MX27 Leventor]Leventor seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.
[MX27 Leventor]Leventor seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.
	Maybe if you increase your Strength...
[MX27 Leventor]Leventor is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.
	Flawless skills.
[MX27 Leventor]Leventor is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	It's surprising to see such advanced technology.
[MX27 Leventor]Leventor plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.
	We'll see about it after the League.
[MX27 Leventor]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Leventor and talk about what to do.
	Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.
[MX27 Leventor]Leventor seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.
	I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.
[MX27 Leventor]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!
[MX27 Leventor]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	I guess he's happy this is a good match.
[MX27 Leventor]Leventor's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next match. What should we say to him?
	If you keep it up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.

	We have to keep on going.

	Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.
[MX27 Leventor]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.
[MX27 Leventor]Leventor is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.
[MX27 Leventor]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Leventor is starting to get intimidated.
	This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.

[MX54 Butcher]You see Butcher's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Butcher. What should we do?

	We can overcome this with team effort.

	I'm sure there were multiple reasons on why the kingdom fell. It's sad to hear such stories.

[MX54 Butcher]You visit Merlin's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Can't you cook ramen by yourself?
[MX54 Butcher]You're watching the storm with Butcher and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.

	Littre will be fine.
[MX54 Butcher]Butcher's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Butcher seems to be nervous. Let's talk to him.
	That player is just messing with you.
[MX54 Butcher]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Butcher.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[MX54 Butcher]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's give them a hand.
[MX54 Butcher]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Butcher and his opponent isn't over yet.

[MX82 Vann]Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Vann is asking how he did in the match.
	You bring the best out of the team. Good work!
[MX82 Vann]Vann looks excited as he's talking with the team about pets. He turns around and asks you what kind of pet you like.
	I think that a baby duck following its mother is one of the most adorable things to watch.
[MX82 Vann]You come across Vann thinking about the value of soccer. What should we tell him?
	The field is a ground of hopes and dreams. Isn't that enough?
[MX82 Vann]Vann is having trouble focusing on the match because of the affectionate emotion he feels. He says he must leave now to propose to his lover. What should we say?

[MX82 Vann]Vann feels his heart races when he sees Littre.
	...Do you want a Superb Power-up?

[MX82 Vann]Vann continues to charge into the opponent's defense line and keeps failing. What should we do?

[MX82 Vann]Vann is being annoying with his offensive words. What should we do?
	(Kick him out of the team if things can't be handled.)
[MX82 Vann]It's dinner time and Vann is staring at his carrot soup with a troubled look. What should we do?
	(Tell him that carrots are good for the body and to eat it all.)
[MX82 Vann]It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking up for the morning training. What should we tell Vann to do?
	They all need scolding.
[MX82 Vann]Vann says that the soup tastes funny. What should we do?
	Let's stay away from the soup, just in case.
[MX82 Vann]Vann is furious about the referee that's clearly favoring the other team. Should we stop him?

[MX82 Vann]It suddenly began to rain heavily. You see Vann running up ahead.

	Those scumbags played dirty. Ugh, I'm angry!
[MX82 Vann]Vann is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.
	I'm not comfortable with this conversation.
[MX82 Vann]Vann, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal what your agenda really is. What should we say?
	To bring justice with soccer. That's all.
[MX82 Vann]Vann says to you that it was an honor to be able to play with you. Let's give him an answer.
	Let's do our best until the very end!
[MX82 Vann]You're having a conversation with Vann about the power of Spirit Stones which is covered in secrets. Let's tell him what you think.
	I won't rely on Spirit Stones.
[MX82 Vann]Vann is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''
	I like what you just said.
[MX82 Vann]Let's talk to Vann who recently started to take interest in the world of angels.
	It's a place to rest for the good.

	It's something I'd want to see again with a person I care.
[MX82 Vann]The teammates are speaking highly of Vann, saying he's a good role model. Let's add in.
	He's truly a role model to us all with his skills and attitude.
[MX82 Vann]You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?
	I feel sorry, but that's irrelevant to the match.
[MX82 Vann]Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Vann wants to say a word.
	Come on guys, you know it's an exciting thing to be playing against a strong team! Keep your heads up high!
[MX82 Vann]You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.
	So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.

	We will confront them fair and square, and win.
[MX82 Vann]The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?
	Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?
[MX82 Vann]Vann points out that the time the men of Minerva died and the time the epidemic broke out in Metro City matches.
	That's too convenient to be a coincidence.
[MX82 Vann]Mortor and Wizol of the Peacemakers are helping an old man. Vann seems to be surprised.
	Well, what do you know! They have some decency in them after all.
[MX82 Vann]A big fight broke out between an angel and a demon within the team. Vann is asking for help.

	Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.
[Mariel]Mariel plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	I'm thinking of opening a shop.
[Mariel]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Mariel and talk about what to do.
	I hope they have a ''Continue'' button around here.

[Meg]Meg is furious about the referee that's clearly favoring the other team. Should we stop her?
	(Step on the referee's foot and pretend it was an accident.)
[Meg]It suddenly began to rain heavily. You see Meg running up ahead.
	(Let her steal your umbrella.)
[Meg]You witnessed a player on the other side putting a tack in Meg's shoe.
	(Tell Meg who did this.)
[Meg]During the team meeting, you find a player sleeping. What should you do?
	(Leave it to Meg.)
[Meg]Meg hurt her leg during the 1st half of the match, but she insists on playing. What should we tell her?
	Okay. You make them pay, understand?

[Meg]Meg says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?
	Of course! Everybody is counting on you!
[Meg]Meg asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give her a sincere answer.
	I want to see everybody smile. I think that'll make me happy.
[Meg]Meg is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.
	I'd like to keep one as a pet.
[Meg]Meg looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?
	Where do you think those comets are going?
[Meg]Meg says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.
	Yeah, I mean they could get hurt.
[Meg]Meg wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.
	I'm planning to make a whole line of merchandise with them as the character.
[Meg]Meg is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.
	Life is a light of its own.
[Meg]Meg says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	Just hear them out and smile. They'll feel better.
[Meg]Meg says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	I sense that there's something she hasn't told us yet...
[Meg]Meg seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?
	Congratulations! How did you guys get along?
[Meg]Meg is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?
	You're playing soccer! You're fine!
[Meg]Meg says she's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.
	Tell her to be our lap cat.
[Meg]Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Meg seems to be troubled. What should we do?
	If you guys keep giving Meg trouble, I swear to god I'll use you both as special training material.
[Meg]Meg is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	She seems like a nice girl.
[Meg]Meg went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	Meg is in danger! We have to save her!
[Meg]Meg claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	She must've made a mistake.
[Meg]Meg seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	We can do this! Let's go!
[Meg]Meg says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	Yeah, they get along pretty well.
[Meg]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Meg hands you a present.
	(A cute and pretty pendant)
[Meg]Meg says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.
	I think she likes him.

[Melchior]Melchior is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.
	Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.
[Melchior]Melchior is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?
	It's the place of dreams colliding.
[Melchior]Melchior wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	Why don't you join them and find out?
[Melchior]Melchior is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.
	Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!
[Melchior]Melchior is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.
	Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!
[Melchior]Melchior is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.
	My fans!
[Melchior]This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?
	Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.
[Melchior]Melchior says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	He'll remember someday.
[Melchior]The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.
	Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!
[Melchior]Melchior seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.
[Melchior]Ogre's pony tail slapped Melchior in the face!
	That must hurt.
[Melchior]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
[Melchior]Melchior is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.
	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[Melchior]Melchior says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[Melchior]Melchior says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[Melchior]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Melchior]Melchior picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[Melchior]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Melchior]Melchior is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[Melchior]Melchior thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[Melchior]Melchior says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?
	I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.
[Melchior]Melchior asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give her a sincere answer.
	I guess I'll be chasing you on the road of glory.
[Melchior]Melchior is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.
	I think they're cute and elegant if you leave out the pig and bear. 
[Melchior]Melchior looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?
	The space has prepared this beautiful stage for you.
[Melchior]Melchior says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.
	They're young but they have passion.
[Melchior]Melchior wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.
	Thankful beings that will be our +160.
[Melchior]Melchior is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.
	How about we make it to the top of the Galaxy League and shine the universe with the light within us?
[Melchior]Melchior says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	Tell them they should remember that they play for you.
[Melchior]Melchior says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	Did she think that you'll take over the throne?
[Melchior]Melchior seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?
	Good for you! I know it's hard for you to find someone at your level!
[Melchior]Melchior is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?
	I don't think you need to worry about a diet.
[Melchior]Melchior says she's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.
	Ask her if she likes you and if she wants to join our team.
[Melchior]Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Melchior seems to be troubled. What should we do?
	You both need to be disciplined by Melchior.
[Melchior]Melchior is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	You seem like the princess...Scratch that, the queen.
[Melchior]Melchior went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	I feel sorry for the other team.
[Melchior]Melchior claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	I don't care what the case is.
[Melchior]Melchior seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	Be careful not to be stomped on...
[Melchior]Melchior says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	That's strange. I thought he was more of an authoritative character.
[Melchior]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Melchior hands you a present.
	(A chocker with a pretty radical design.)
[Melchior]Melchior says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.
	That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy, and love.

[Melisa]Melisa is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.
	We haven't awakened our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyond!
[Melisa]Melisa is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?
	It's the place where the chosen ones learn about their destiny.
[Melisa]Melisa wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	All goes as planned...Hmm? Just ignore that.
[Melisa]Melisa is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.

[Melisa]Melisa is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.
	This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!
[Melisa]Melisa is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.
	My friends from previous life...They would be pleased to see me win.
[Melisa]This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?
	I'm going to check out the new comic issues. Wanna come along?
[Melisa]Melisa says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	Hmm, a revived person that forgot his purpose...Reminds me of somebody.
[Melisa]The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.
	What a depressing weather...
[Melisa]Melisa seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?

[Melisa]Ogre's pony tail slapped Melisa in the face!
	Even his hair is a weapon! Is that even allowed?
[Melisa]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.
[Melisa]Melisa is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.
	I knew this day would come.
[Melisa]Melisa says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.
[Melisa]Melisa says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?
	You can only find your true potential when you don't rely on your skills!
[Melisa]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	Fontus...You sure are my archnemesis!
[Melisa]Melisa picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	So, this is how the revelation begins!
[Melisa]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?
[Melisa]Melisa is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.
	It's time, Melisa! Awaken the 6th attribute and show your true powers!
[Melisa]Melisa thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	That's because you haven't opened up your ''third eye''!

[Melisa]Melisa is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.
	What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?
[Melisa]Melisa, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.
[Melisa]Melisa announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	You'll have to compete with me!
[Melisa]Melisa is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
	Come on, cheer up. You're not being yourself.
[Melisa]Melisa wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
	It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.
[Melisa]It seems that Melisa is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Listen carefully and you'll find her.
[Melisa]You find Melisa lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!
[Melisa]Melisa says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Hmm? That is odd...What do you think about this?

	I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!
[Melisa]Melisa wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	What about just watching?
[Melisa]Melisa caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	You came to see my marvelous moves? I'm flattered. 
[Melisa]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Melisa some orders.
	Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!
[Melisa]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	Stop right there, pig!
[Melisa]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Melisa seems to be worried.
	Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.
[Melisa]Melisa came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?
[Melisa]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...It's about to go down...! Where's the popcorn?
[Melisa]Melisa is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	Who could've done such a hideous thing?

	Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Melisa!
[Melisa]Melisa looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	How about we ask Jeunese?
[Melisa]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Melisa to set some simple rules.
	Come on, I'll show you the best spots around!

[Metatron]You find Metatron lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?

	It's something I'd want to see again with a person I care.

	I feel sorry, but that's irrelevant to the match.
[Metatron]Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Metatron wants to say a word.
	Come on guys, you know it's an exciting thing to be playing against a strong team! Keep your heads up high!
[Metatron]You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.

	We will confront them fair and square, and win.
[Metatron]The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?
	Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?
[Metatron]Metatron points out that the time the men of Minerva died and the time the epidemic broke out in Metro City matches.
	That's too convenient to be a coincidence.

	That player must have a heart of gold.

	That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.

	Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...
[Metatron EE]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Metatron. Let's talk to her.
	(Ignore.)
[Metatron EE]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Metatron is curious and wants to take a look.
	We should probably ignore them and just walk by.
[Metatron EE]Metatron brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	Throw it away. NOW.

[Micki]You come across Micki, who was overwhelmed by her opponent throughout the game. Let's cheer her up.
	Those scumbags played dirty. Ugh, I'm angry!
[Micki]Micki is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.
	I'm not comfortable with this conversation.
[Micki]Micki, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal who you really are. What should we answer?
	To bring justice with soccer. That's all.
[Micki]Micki says to you that it was an honor to be able to play with you. Let's give her an answer.
	Let's do our best until the very end!
[Micki]You're having a conversation with Micki about the power of Spirit Stones which is covered in secrets. Let's tell her what you think.
	I won't rely on Spirit Stones.
[Micki]Micki is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''
	I like what you just said.
[Micki]Let's talk to Micki who recently started to take interest in the world of angels.
	It's a place to rest for the good.
[Micki]Micki is asking you if you ever saw the World Tree. Let's tell her your thoughts.
	It's something I'd want to see again with a person I care.
[Micki]The teammates are speaking highly of Micki, saying she's a good role model. Let's add in.
	She's truly a role model to us all with her skills and attitude.
[Micki]You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?
	I feel sorry, but that's irrelevant to the match.
[Micki]Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Micki wants to say a word.
	Come on guys, you know it's an exciting thing to be playing against a strong team! Keep your heads up high!
[Micki]You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.
	So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.
[Micki]Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?
	We will confront them fair and square, and win.
[Micki]The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?
	Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?
[Micki]Micki points out that the time the men of Minerva died and the time the epidemic broke out in Metro City matches.
	That's too convenient to be a coincidence.
[Micki]Mortor and Wizol of the Peacemakers are helping an old man. Micki seems to be surprised.
	Well, what do you know! They have some decency in them after all.
[Micki]A big fight broke out between an angel and a demon within the team. Micki is asking for help.
	I hope the demon didn't say anything stupid.
[Micki]Cracsus threatens to hack Micki's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?
	Don't fall for this cheap shot.
[Micki]Micki is thinking about what Selena said about saving the galaxy if we win the Galaxy League.
	Then we should do our very best to win.
[Micki]Micki is thinking about what the Universe of Oblivion is.
	I don't like the word oblivion.

[Micki]Micki seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.
	They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.
[Micki]With a serious face, Micki is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.
	A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?
[Micki]Micki came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	Just please go with that boring strategy.
[Micki]Micki is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.
	They're on cooldown.
[Micki]The team is having a good run and Micki is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	As long as we're not used as training material...
[Micki]Micki seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)
[Micki]Micki seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.
	Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.
[Micki]Micki is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.
	Well, having a good ace skill is a start.
[Micki]Micki is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.
[Micki]Micki plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	I'm thinking of opening a shop.
[Micki]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Micki and talk about what to do.
	I hope they have a ''Continue'' button around here.
[Micki]Micki seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.
	Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!
[Micki]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	Cool! Awesome!
[Micki]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	Has he gone mad?
[Micki]Micki's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?
	Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.
[Micki]During a match, Micki bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?
	Wasn't that a glitch?
[Micki]Micki is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.
	I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.
[Micki]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.
[Micki]Micki is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.
[Micki]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Micki is starting to get intimidated.
	He's obviously obsessed with soccer.

[Mider]Mider is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to him.
	We haven't awakened our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyond!
[Mider]Mider is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help him?
	It's the place where the chosen ones learn about their destiny.
[Mider]Mider wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	All goes as planned...Hmm? Just ignore that.
[Mider]Mider is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became his life. Let's talk with him.
	And that's how we walk towards our destiny.
[Mider]Mider is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give him an opinion.
	This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!
[Mider]Mider is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.
	My friends from previous life...They would be pleased to see me win.
[Mider]This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?
	I'm going to check out the new comic issues. Wanna come along?
[Mider]Mider says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	Hmm, a revived person that forgot his purpose...Reminds me of somebody.
[Mider]The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.
	What a depressing weather...
[Mider]Mider seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	That's a dangerous secret you're trying to find out about. Do you still want to know?
[Mider]Ogre's pony tail slapped Mider in the face!
	Even his hair is a weapon! Is that even allowed?
[Mider]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.
[Mider]Mider is suddenly showing massive improvement in his performance. He must've learned something during a match.
	I knew this day would come.
[Mider]Mider says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.
[Mider]Mider says he forgot to use his skill points before entering the match. What should we say to him?
	You can only find your true potential when you don't rely on your skills!
[Mider]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	Fontus...You sure are my archnemesis!
[Mider]Mider picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	So, this is how the revelation begins!
[Mider]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?
[Mider]Mider is irritated because his opponent has the attribute advantage over him.
	It's time, Mider! Awaken the 6th attribute and show your true powers!
[Mider]Mider thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	That's because you haven't opened up your ''third eye''!

[Mider]Mider is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	I led our team to victory with wedgies!
[Mider]This was the worst game in your entire life...Mider comes to you to cheer you up.
	Please explain why you kicked the ball into our goal post, will you?
[Mider]You're talking to Mider about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow. Let's tell him your answer.
	If it's the end of the world, I'd pull of a crazy performance in a densely populated area before I go!
[Mider]Mider is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to him.
	Aren't you the one everybody should be afraid of?
[Mider]Mider is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give him some advice.
	I hope you get scouted by an interesting team.
[Mider]Mider isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. He feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
	Let's invest some Crystals and get new players!
[Mider]With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Mider for solutions.
	How about we put that advanced technology of Metro City to use?
[Mider]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	We could start a reset marathon.
[Mider]You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Mider and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest. 
	I could really use some grilled sweet potatoes and chestnuts.
[Mider]Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
	I think she's something more than just an idol.
[Mider]According to Mider's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
	I want to see Tyler's true characteristics.
[Mider]Mider thinks he knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
	Of course we should tell Lynbell! What are you waiting for?
[Mider]Mider won a trip around the world from a radio event!
	...World? What about space? Isn't that more interesting?
[Mider]Mider suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.
	What's the agenda here? Are you trying to taint the pure angels?
[Mider]The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.
	I didn't know I was a talented foot volleyball player!
[Mider]You're sick and in bed when Mider and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?
	Get closer so I can spread my germs!
[Mider]The match and the concert that Mider was looking for start at the same time...
	Let's hack the big screen so we can see the concert!
[Mider]Mider wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
	The character story left him a trauma.
[Mider]MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
	...Maybe he just likes cats!
[Mider]The match started and Mider is standing still doing nothing.
	What is he doing? Is he a totem?

[Miho]Miho is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.
	We need a decent level of personal performance.
[Miho]Miho, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've never dreamt about soccer.
[Miho]Miho announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	I have faith in you.
[Miho]Miho is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
	That doesn't change what we must do.
[Miho]Miho wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
	Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
[Miho]It seems that Miho is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Miho? Nah, she never gets lost.
[Miho]You find Miho lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[Miho]Miho says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
[Miho]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[Miho]Miho wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
[Miho]Miho caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[Miho]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Miho some orders.
	Let's try out some forward passes.
[Miho]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	It's time we use him as training material.
[Miho]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Miho seems to be worried.
	It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.
[Miho]Miho came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I hope that wasn't all you got.
[Miho]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...We should get out of here.
[Miho]Miho is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
[Miho]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Miho seems to be sick of this.
	Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
[Miho]Miho looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	It's space. Anything can exist here.
[Miho]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Miho to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

[Miho]Miho is asking you what you think is it that makes this team great. You weren't expecting this, but you should give her an answer.
	You. I know you're doing much for the team without taking any credit.
[Miho]Miho is angry because she was criticized by her performance and is asking your opinion. Let's give her an answer.
	I want to practice with you, if that's okay with you. No?
[Miho]Miho, who has shown absolutely superb chemistry with you, is embarrassed and says she didn't do all of that because of you. What should we say?
	Yeah? Well, I did what I did for you.
[Miho]Miho wants to have an academic conversation about the 5th dimension, string theory, and other infamously hard space theories. Why...?
	(Maybe she brought snacks but is too shy to share it with me.)
[Miho]Miho looks disappointed about the size of the Galaxy League. What would be an appropriate response?
	Nervous? Trust me. I got you.
[Miho]Miho seems to be uncomfortable to hear about the love life of other teammates. Let's talk to her.
	Should we join the club?
[Miho]Miho is talking about how famous her rivals are in the Galaxy League. She seems jealous. Let's talk to her.
	I'll be your rival from now.
[Miho]Miho is furious about how Lucian is always surrounded by girls. What should we say?
	Are you jealous?
[Miho]Kirin suddenly appears, pats Miho on the head while teasing her, and then goes away. Miho seems angry...
	...I think you liked it more than you thought...
[Miho]The team is at Metro City. Miho seems to be surprised how the people of Metro City have mechanical bodies.
	You have a heart of gold.
[Miho]Kuma is furiously chasing Ogre. Miho seems confused.
	Two bears...Which one is Kuma?
[Miho]Miho is spreading the happy news about her cousin having a baby. Let's congratulate her.
	So, the numerous baby clothes you've been making were all for this day?
[Miho]The team seems very nervous facing Skalardra. What should we do?
	Huh? I think Miho is prettier.
[Miho]Miho refuses to listen to anybody's advice saying he's the best and he doesn't need any advice. Let's talk to her.
	Are you angry because I wasn't there to oversee your training? I said I'm sorry!
[Miho]Miho is interested in Selena and is asking for your opinion. What should we say?
	Be honest and show a sincere attitude.
[Miho]Miho seems to be interested in the Micrinum from Kiri, which is said to be good for beauty and anti-aging. Let's talk to her.
	You're young and good looking even without that.
[Miho]Miho seems to be determined to crush the opposing team. Let's give her some advice.
	That's the spirit! Let's teach them a lesson!
[Miho]Miho looks sad because she feels her friendship with a friend in a rival team is falling apart. What should we say to her?
	Try starting off with some small talk.
[Miho]It's a tough match, but Miho is standing tall and encouraging the team. What should we say to her?
	Your spirit is an inspiration to us all.
[Miho]A teammate that is a former member of the Dark Sisters is down sick, suffering from the aftermath of performing exorcism. Let's talk with Miho about what to do.
	Let's go visit her. Some fun won't do any harm. It might even cheer her up!

[Mika]Mika is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	The other team went home crying!
[Mika]This was the worst game in your entire life...Mika comes to you to cheer you up.
	Thanks...I know you're the one that's the most devastated...Let's do better next time.
[Mika]You're talking to Mika about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow. Let's tell her your answer.
	Hmm, there's a guy I'd like to beat up before I die.
[Mika]Mika is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.
	It's only a sport! The strongest team wins, and we are strong!
[Mika]Mika is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.
	Make the scouters fall in love with your performance!
[Mika]Mika isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
	We may have to go rough on the team and make them realize the problem.
[Mika]With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Mika for solutions.
	We won't be able to win the league if we fail to overcome this. 
[Mika]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	We're going to hunt that manager down and take back our money. We will show no mercy!
[Mika]You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Mika and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest. 
	There's no time for tears! Find out who did this and bring justice!
[Mika]Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
	The stage is so majestic! It's awesome!
[Mika]According to Mika's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
	William doesn't know how to respect his seniors.
[Mika]Mika thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
	...Sometimes, the truth is better to be left a secret.
[Mika]Mika won a trip around the world from a radio event!
	What about soccer? You'll have to go through me to go on that trip!
[Mika]Mika suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.
	This is a good chance to show the baby angels how rough soccer can be!
[Mika]The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.
	Care to receive the ball with your face?
[Mika]You're sick and in bed when Mika and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?
	You guys...I'm about to cry...
[Mika]The match and the concert that Mika was looking for start at the same time...
	Channel that sorrow and rage towards your opponents and make them pay.
[Mika]Mika wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
	Maybe he just wants to duke it out.
[Mika]MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
	Stop right there!
[Mika]The match started and Mika is standing still doing nothing.
	Run! Just start running!

[Mika]Mika is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.
	We need a decent level of personal performance.
[Mika]Mika, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.

[Mika]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Mika to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

[Mikael]You find Mikael depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer him up.
	You did well and I thank you for that.
[Mikael]Mikael is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.
	That's why I need your help.
[Mikael]You come across Mikael being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to him.
	Are you feeling alright?
[Mikael]Mikael is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give him an answer.
	I was always looking forward for that moment.
[Mikael]Mikael is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to him.
	It's just a dream. Forget about it.
[Mikael]Mikael is stressed out saying his opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	You can overcome this like always. Right?
[Mikael]Mikael seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to him.
	I'm starting to see true strength in this team.
[Mikael]You come across Mikael who is limping. He says it's nothing. What should we do?
	Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.
[Mikael]You visit Merlin's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Can't you cook ramen by yourself?
[Mikael]You're watching the storm with Mikael and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	What's wrong with her?
[Mikael]Mikael looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Littre will be fine.
[Mikael]Mikael's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Mikael seems to be nervous. Let's talk to him.
	That player is just messing with you.
[Mikael]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Mikael.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Mikael]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's give them a hand.
[Mikael]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Mikael and his opponent isn't over yet.
	You better win that fight!
[Mikael]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Mikael do?
	(Let him take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)
[Mikael]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	They will never learn with an attitude like that.
[Mikael]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Mikael. What should you say?
	Well, Mikael does have that kind of charm.
[Mikael]Mikael is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Can you peel this guy off of me?
[Mikael]Latios is chatting with Mikael after the match. Let's barge in.
	I'm looking forward to our next match!

[Mikael]Mikael says he's the center of the team and asks if you agree with him. How should we answer?
	Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.
[Mikael]Mikael asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give him a sincere answer.
	I'm going to make a joke before I start crying!
[Mikael]Mikael is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.
	Do you think they'll be tasty?
[Mikael]Mikael looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to him?
	Do you think any of those comets are populated?
[Mikael]Mikael says he's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give him an answer.
	Teach them how adults play soccer.
[Mikael]Mikael wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give him an answer.
	Beginner level monsters in an RPG game.
[Mikael]Mikael is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to him.
	That's deep. I think it's cool.
[Mikael]Mikael says he was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.
[Mikael]Mikael says that Bell seemed depressed when he told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry.
[Mikael]Mikael seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell him?
	Don't forget that we exist! Haha!
[Mikael]Mikael is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?
	Please don't forget about the match.
[Mikael]Mikael says he's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.
	Is her name really Kiki?
[Mikael]Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Mikael seems to be troubled. What should we do?
	If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?
[Mikael]Mikael is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.
[Mikael]Mikael went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	We should think about how to make fun of him when he comes back.
[Mikael]Mikael claims he saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	Maybe Sophie is actually a male...?
[Mikael]Mikael seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?
[Mikael]Mikael says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.
[Mikael]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Mikael hands you a present.
	(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)
[Mikael]Mikael says that he thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give him an answer.
	Maybe she's up to something.

[Mikael]Mikael seems to be lost after having a good match while his fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to him.
	Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.
[Mikael]With a serious face, Mikael is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give him an answer.
	Being together is enough for me.
[Mikael]Mikael came to you after the match, and says he's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.
[Mikael]Mikael is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.
	Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?
[Mikael]The team is having a good run and Mikael is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	Let's keep this momentum going!
[Mikael]Mikael seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	Let's open up a bright future with this ball.
[Mikael]Mikael seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.
	Don't be weak.
[Mikael]Mikael is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.
	Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.
[Mikael]Mikael is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.
[Mikael]Mikael plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.
	I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.
[Mikael]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Mikael and talk about what to do.
	We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.
[Mikael]Mikael seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.
	I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great. 
[Mikael]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	...Uh...So no soccer?
[Mikael]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!
[Mikael]Mikael's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next match. What should we say to him?
	Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.
[Mikael]During a match, Mikael bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?
	It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.
[Mikael]Mikael is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to him.
	It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.
[Mikael]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.
[Mikael]Mikael is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.
[Mikael]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Mikael is starting to get intimidated.
	Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.

[Mikel]Mikel is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.
	Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.
[Mikel]Mikel is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?
	It's the place of dreams colliding.
[Mikel]Mikel wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	Why don't you join them and find out?
[Mikel]Mikel is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.
	Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!
[Mikel]Mikel is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.
	Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!
[Mikel]Mikel is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.
	My fans!
[Mikel]This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?
	Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.
[Mikel]Mikel says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	He'll remember someday.
[Mikel]The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.
	Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!
[Mikel]Mikel seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.
[Mikel]Ogre's pony tail slapped Mikel in the face!
	That must hurt.
[Mikel]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
[Mikel]Mikel is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.
	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[Mikel]Mikel says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[Mikel]Mikel says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[Mikel]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Mikel]Mikel picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[Mikel]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Mikel]Mikel is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[Mikel]Mikel thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[Mikel]You find Mikel depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.
	You did well and I thank you for that.
[Mikel]Mikel is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.
	That's why I need your help.
[Mikel]You come across Mikel being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.
	Are you feeling alright?
[Mikel]Mikel is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.
	I was always looking forward for that moment.
[Mikel]Mikel is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.
	It's just a dream. Forget about it.
[Mikel]Mikel is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	You can overcome this like always. Right?
[Mikel]Mikel seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	I'm starting to see true strength in this team.
[Mikel]You come across Mikel who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?
	Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.
[Mikel]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Can't you cook ramen by yourself?
[Mikel]You're watching the storm with Mikel and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	What's wrong with her?
[Mikel]Mikel looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Littre will be fine.
[Mikel]Mikel's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Mikel seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	That player is just messing with you.
[Mikel]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Mikel.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Mikel]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's give them a hand.
[Mikel]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Mikel and her opponent isn't over yet.
	You better win that fight!
[Mikel]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Mikel do?
	(Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)
[Mikel]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	They will never learn with an attitude like that.
[Mikel]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Mikel. What should you say?
	Well, Mikel does have that kind of charm.
[Mikel]Mikel is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Can you peel this guy off of me?
[Mikel]Latios is chatting with Mikel after the match. Let's barge in.
	I'm looking forward to our next match!

[Milky Way]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Milky Way asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	Wow. I'm sooooo happy.
[Milky Way]Milky Way suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.
[Milky Way]Milky Way is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.
	(Pat her on the head.)
[Milky Way]Milky Way has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.
	I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.
[Milky Way]As Milky Way said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.
	I'm sure it's going in a good direction.
[Milky Way]The crowd is cheering for Milky Way. Milky Way seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.
	They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.
[Milky Way]Milky Way is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.
	I am so thankful to them.
[Milky Way]Milky Way was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.
	Oh, that'll be so cute!
[Milky Way]The team will not have a match for some time. Milky Way asks you about your plan.
	Hmm, wanna go shopping?
[Milky Way]It's a very intense match and Milky Way falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Milky Way up and the two exchange smiles.
	That player must have a heart of gold.
[Milky Way]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
[Milky Way]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Milky Way having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?
[Milky Way]Milky Way is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.
	Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.
[Milky Way]Milky Way scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!
	Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?
[Milky Way]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Milky Way.
	It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.
[Milky Way]Milky Way falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?
	Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.
[Milky Way]Milky Way lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?
[Milky Way]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Milky Way. Let's talk to her.
	Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.
[Milky Way]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Milky Way is curious and wants to take a look.
	They must love volunteer work!
[Milky Way]Milky Way brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...

[Milky Way]You find Milky Way depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.
	It's not your fault that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!
[Milky Way]Milky Way is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.
	Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes. You're a precious part of this team.
[Milky Way]You come across Milky Way being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.
	Don't use that ability on the field...
[Milky Way]Milky Way is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.
	Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes, will you?
[Milky Way]Milky Way is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.
	I'll sleep by your side tonight.
[Milky Way]Milky Way is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.
[Milky Way]Milky Way seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	Perfect! No mistakes made!
[Milky Way]You come across Milky Way who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?
	I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.
[Milky Way]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.
[Milky Way]You're watching the storm with Milky Way and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!
[Milky Way]Milky Way looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.
[Milky Way]Milky Way's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Milky Way seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	I think that player likes you.
[Milky Way]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Milky Way.
	You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.
[Milky Way]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!
[Milky Way]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Milky Way and her opponent isn't over yet.
	Hey! The match is over!
[Milky Way]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Milky Way do?
	(Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.)
[Milky Way]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.
[Milky Way]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Milky Way. What should you say?
	Well, you're as cute as Milky Way.
[Milky Way]Milky Way is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Don't come over here! It's dangerous!
[Milky Way]Latios is chatting with Milky Way after the match. Let's barge in.
	Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's our pretty girl.

[Mimi]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Mimi asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!
[Mimi]Mimi suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!
[Mimi]Mimi is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.
	(Put your thumbs up, wink, and send a juicy smile.)
[Mimi]Mimi has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.
	Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it. You should keep that going.

	We can play soccer with the penguins!
[Mimi]The team will not have a match for some time. Mimi asks you about your plan.
	We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.
[Mimi]It's a very intense match and Mimi falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Mimi up and the two exchange smiles.
	True sportsmanship! Wonderful!
[Mimi]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.
[Mimi]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Mimi having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?

[Mimi]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Mimi. Let's talk to her.
	We'll win next time!

[Min]Min is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.
	It's all thanks to you.
[Min]After a meeting, Min's eyes met yours a several times and Min asks if he has something on his face.
	I was just thinking the team became stronger, thanks to you.
[Min]With a serious look on his face, Min warns you to go to the bathroom before the match.
	I'm surprised you said that. I won't ask what happened to you.
[Min]Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Min on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?
	You and I are already perfect. So I guess that means we shouldn't be saying our names.
[Min]Min is worried that he has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous things. What should we tell him?
	You're the most dangerous of them all.
[Min]Min is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to him.
	Let's go tell the manager.
[Min]Min is asking if you have a special person who you would like to share happy moments with. Let's give him an answer.
	I think that may be you.
[Min]You find Min being very excited after performing an awesome play. How will you react?
	Nice play! Fantastic!
[Min]Min is having trouble focusing on the match. Let's help him out.
	Just calm down a bit. You got this.
[Min]Min is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.
	He's just material for leveling up.
[Min]Min doesn't like the new team advertisement video.
	It didn't portray your awesome performance.
[Min]It's Min's birthday. Let's give him a present.
	This is a championship trophy replica for you. The designs are inspired by you.
[Min]You see Min's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Min. What should we do?
	He is probably not even listening...
[Min]The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?
	It's time for some good food.
[Min]You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also Min's rival, has been severely injured and is in the hospital. What should you say to him?
	This won't be the end of your rival. 
[Min]Min comes to you and says that he has to leave the team because of personal reasons. What should we say?
	Well, I don't want to be the one holding you back. Good luck!
[Min]Min is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with Min.
	I'll try to have the ball come your way.
[Min]Min is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.
	Pathetic...That is no king.
[Min]You got a couple of tickets to Veronica's live concert. Min seems to be interested.
	These are for you, of course. Here.
[Min]Min says he wants to cry because the goal keeper on the other team just won't go down no matter how many shots he makes.
	Let's come up with a new strategy to give you more synergy.

[Min]Min seems to be lost after having a good match while his fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to him.
	They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.
[Min]With a serious face, Min is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give him an answer.
	A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?
[Min]Min came to you after the match, and says he's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	Just please go with that boring strategy.
[Min]Min is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.
	They're on cooldown.
[Min]The team is having a good run and Min is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	As long as we're not used as training material...
[Min]Min seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)
[Min]Min seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.
	Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.
[Min]Min is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.
	Well, having a good ace skill is a start.
[Min]Min is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.
[Min]Min plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.
	I'm thinking of opening a shop.
[Min]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Min and talk about what to do.
	I hope they have a ''Continue'' button around here.
[Min]Min seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.
	Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!
[Min]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	Cool! Awesome!
[Min]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	Has he gone mad?
[Min]Min's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next match. What should we say to him?
	Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.
[Min]During a match, Min bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?
	Wasn't that a glitch?

	I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.

	Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.
[Min]Min is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.

[Mira]Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Mira is asking how she did in the match.
	You bring the best out of the team. Good work!
[Mira]Mira looks excited as she's talking with the team about pets. She turns around and asks you what kind of pet you like.

[Mira]You come across Mira thinking about the value of soccer. What should we tell her?
	The field is a ground of hopes and dreams. Isn't that enough?

	(Tell her that carrots are good for the body and to eat it all.)
[Mira]It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking up for the morning training. What should we tell Mira to do?
	They all need scolding.
[Mira]Mira says that the soup tastes funny. What should we do?
	Let's stay away from the soup, just in case.
[Mira]Mira is furious about the referee that's clearly favoring the other team. Should we stop her?

[Mireille]Mireille is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	They were a worthy opponent.
[Mireille]This was the worst game in your entire life...Mireille comes to you to cheer you up.

	I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.

	Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
[Mireille]Mireille isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
	Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.
[Mireille]With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Mireille for solutions.
	I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
[Mireille]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.

[Mireille]The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.
	Let's see what you have to say after the match.

[Morgana]Morgana is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.
	I'm not comfortable with this conversation.
[Morgana]Morgana, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal who you really are. What should we answer?
	To bring justice with soccer. That's all.
[Morgana]Morgana says to you that it was an honor to be able to play with you. Let's give her an answer.
	Let's do our best until the very end!

	I won't rely on Spirit Stones.
[Morgana]Morgana is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''

[Morgana]Let's talk to Morgana who recently started to take interest in the world of angels.

[Morgana]Morgana is asking you if you ever saw the World Tree. Let's tell her your thoughts.
	It's something I'd want to see again with a person I care.
[Morgana]The teammates are speaking highly of Morgana, saying she's a good role model. Let's add in.
	She's truly a role model to us all with her skills and attitude.
[Morgana]You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?
	I feel sorry, but that's irrelevant to the match.
[Morgana]Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Morgana wants to say a word.
	Come on guys, you know it's an exciting thing to be playing against a strong team! Keep your heads up high!
[Morgana]You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.
	So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.
[Morgana]Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?
	We will confront them fair and square, and win.
[Morgana]The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?
	Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?
[Morgana]Morgana points out that the time the men of Minerva died and the time the epidemic broke out in Metro City matches.
	That's too convenient to be a coincidence.
[Morgana]Mortor and Wizol of the Peacemakers are helping an old man. Morgana seems to be surprised.
	Well, what do you know! They have some decency in them after all.
[Morgana]A big fight broke out between an angel and a demon within the team. Morgana is asking for help.
	I hope the demon didn't say anything stupid.
[Morgana]Cracsus threatens to hack Morgana's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?
	Don't fall for this cheap shot.
[Morgana]Morgana is thinking about what Selena said about saving the galaxy if we win the Galaxy League.
	Then we should do our very best to win.
[Morgana]Morgana is thinking about what the Universe of Oblivion is.
	I don't like the word oblivion.

	It's all thanks to you.
[Moritz]After a meeting, Moritz's eyes met yours a several times and Moritz asks if she has something on her face.
	I was just thinking the team became stronger, thanks to you.
[Moritz]With a serious look on her face, Moritz warns you to go to the bathroom before the match.
	I'm surprised you said that. I won't ask what happened to you.
[Moritz]Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Moritz on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?
	You and I are already perfect. So I guess that means we shouldn't be saying our names.

	This is a championship trophy replica for you. The designs are inspired by you.
[Moritz]You see Moritz's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Moritz. What should we do?
	She is probably not even listening...
[Moritz]The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?
	It's time for some good food.

	Let's come up with a new strategy to give you more synergy.

	I'm proud that you played your game and didn't descend to the opponent's level.

	If you're better than your teammates, you should be the one to be considerate.

	Just playing soccer, that's all.

	I'm starting to enjoy playing with you.
[Moritz]You're having a conversation with Moritz about the power of Spirit Stones which is covered in secrets. Let's tell her what you think.

	Get yourselves together, guys. Are you going to give up already?

	It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.
[Moritz]Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?
	Pathetic. We'll show them that we're better in many ways.
[Moritz]The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?
	A square match is what suites a proud royalty.
[Moritz]Moritz points out that the time the men of Minerva died and the time the epidemic broke out in Metro City matches.
	It would disgust me if that was the result of an evil plot.
[Moritz]Mortor and Wizol of the Peacemakers are helping an old man. Moritz seems to be surprised.

	What, are you expecting something like ''I feel like I'm in heaven'' or something?

[Mortor]As Mortor said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to him.
	I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.
[Mortor]The crowd is cheering for Mortor. Mortor seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help him out.
	How about just accepting the compliments for today?
[Mortor]Mortor is impressed by the help he received from the elementals. Let's talk to him.
	The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.
[Mortor]Mortor was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin himself. Let's talk to him.
	It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!
[Mortor]The team will not have a match for some time. Mortor asks you about your plan.
	I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.
[Mortor]It's a very intense match and Mortor falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Mortor up and the two exchange smiles.
	Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?
[Mortor]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.
[Mortor]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Mortor having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?

	That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!

	If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.
[Mortor]Mortor lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...
[Mortor]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Mortor. Let's talk to her.
	(Ignore.)
[Mortor]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Mortor is curious and wants to take a look.
	We should probably ignore them and just walk by.
[Mortor]Mortor brought a drink that he says he received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	Throw it away. NOW.

	Hmm, wanna go shopping?
[Muriel]It's a very intense match and Muriel falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Muriel up and the two exchange smiles.
	That player must have a heart of gold.
[Muriel]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
[Muriel]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Muriel having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?
[Muriel]Muriel is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.
	Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.
[Muriel]Muriel scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!
	Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?
[Muriel]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Muriel.
	It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.
[Muriel]Muriel falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?
	Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.

	This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?
[Muriel]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Muriel. Let's talk to her.
	Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.
[Muriel]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Muriel is curious and wants to take a look.
	They must love volunteer work!
[Muriel]Muriel brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...

[Muriel]You find Muriel depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.
	It's not your fault that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!
[Muriel]Muriel is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.
	Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes. You're a precious part of this team.
[Muriel]You come across Muriel being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.
	Don't use that ability on the field...
[Muriel]Muriel is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.
	Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes, will you?
[Muriel]Muriel is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.
	I'll sleep by your side tonight.
[Muriel]Muriel is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?

[Muriel]Muriel seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	Perfect! No mistakes made!
[Muriel]You come across Muriel who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?
	I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.
[Muriel]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.
[Muriel]You're watching the storm with Muriel and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!
[Muriel]Muriel looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.
[Muriel]Muriel's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Muriel seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	I think that player likes you.
[Muriel]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Muriel.
	You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.
[Muriel]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!
[Muriel]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Muriel and her opponent isn't over yet.

[Muspel]Muspel is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give him an opinion.
	Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!
[Muspel]Muspel is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.

	Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.
[Muspel]Muspel says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	He'll remember someday.

[Muspel]Muspel seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.
[Muspel]Ogre's pony tail slapped Muspel in the face!
	That must hurt.
[Muspel]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
[Muspel]Muspel is suddenly showing massive improvement in his performance. He must've learned something during a match.
	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[Muspel]Muspel says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[Muspel]Muspel says he forgot to use his skill points before entering the match. What should we say to him?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[Muspel]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Muspel]Muspel picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[Muspel]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Muspel]Muspel is irritated because his opponent has the attribute advantage over him.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[Muspel]Muspel thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[Muspel]Muspel says he's the center of the team and asks if you agree with him. How should we answer?
	Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.

	That's deep. I think it's cool.

	You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.
[Muspel]Muspel says that Bell seemed depressed when he told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry.
[Muspel]Muspel seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell him?
	Don't forget that we exist! Haha!
[Muspel]Muspel is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?

	If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?
[Muspel]Muspel is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.
[Muspel]Muspel went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	We should think about how to make fun of him when he comes back.
[Muspel]Muspel claims he saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	Maybe Sophie is actually a male...?
[Muspel]Muspel seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?
[Muspel]Muspel says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.
[Muspel]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Muspel hands you a present.
	(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)
[Muspel]Muspel says that he thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give him an answer.
	Maybe she's up to something.

[Mute]Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Mute is asking how she did in the match.
	It was pretty scary watching you so pleased with the rough plays of the opponents.
[Mute]Mute looks excited as she's talking with the team about pets. She turns around and asks you what kind of pet you like.
	I like cats. I like the egoistic side of them.
[Mute]You come across Mute thinking about the value of soccer. What should we tell her?
	I'm sure you can find pleasure inside of the violence of the field.

	Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.
[Nebra]Nebra asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give him a sincere answer.
	I'm going to make a joke before I start crying!

	We should think about how to make fun of him when he comes back.
[Nebra]Nebra claims he saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?

[Neraizel]Neraizel says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[Neraizel]Neraizel says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[Neraizel]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Neraizel]Neraizel picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[Neraizel]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Neraizel]Neraizel is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[Neraizel]Neraizel thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[Neraizel]You come across Neraizel, who was overwhelmed by her opponent throughout the game. Let's cheer her up.
	I'm proud that you played your game and didn't descend to the opponent's level.
[Neraizel]Neraizel is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.
	If you're better than your teammates, you should be the one to be considerate.
[Neraizel]Neraizel, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal who you really are. What should we answer?
	Just playing soccer, that's all.

[Neraizel]You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?
	I'm considering making an anonymous donation.
[Neraizel]Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Neraizel wants to say a word.
	Get yourselves together, guys. Are you going to give up already?
[Neraizel]You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.
	It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.
[Neraizel]Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?
	Pathetic. We'll show them that we're better in many ways.
[Neraizel]The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?
	A square match is what suites a proud royalty.
[Neraizel]Neraizel points out that the time the men of Minerva died and the time the epidemic broke out in Metro City matches.
	It would disgust me if that was the result of an evil plot.

	That player must have a heart of gold.

	That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.

	This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?

	They must love volunteer work!

	I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.

[Net]Net is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give him an answer.
	I was always looking forward for that moment.
[Net]Net is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to him.
	It's just a dream. Forget about it.
[Net]Net is stressed out saying his opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	You can overcome this like always. Right?
[Net]Net seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to him.
	I'm starting to see true strength in this team.
[Net]You come across Net who is limping. He says it's nothing. What should we do?
	Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.
[Net]You visit Merlin's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Can't you cook ramen by yourself?
[Net]You're watching the storm with Net and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	What's wrong with her?
[Net]Net looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Littre will be fine.
[Net]Net's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Net seems to be nervous. Let's talk to him.
	That player is just messing with you.
[Net]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Net.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Net]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's give them a hand.
[Net]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Net and his opponent isn't over yet.
	You better win that fight!
[Net]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Net do?
	(Let him take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)
[Net]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	They will never learn with an attitude like that.
[Net]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Net. What should you say?
	Well, Net does have that kind of charm.
[Net]Net is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Can you peel this guy off of me?
[Net]Latios is chatting with Net after the match. Let's barge in.
	I'm looking forward to our next match!

[Nevantos]Nevantos is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to him.
	It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy! This is nonsense!
[Nevantos]Nevantos is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help him?
	It's stressful because we can't prepare for extraterrestrial sanitation. We're completely exposed to all those unknown...things.
[Nevantos]Nevantos wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	Perfect planning and perfect execution.
[Nevantos]Nevantos is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became his life. Let's talk with him.
	Life, eh? I guess that's a bit too serious for me, but I think I understand how you feel.
[Nevantos]Nevantos is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give him an opinion.
	How about some presents for your parents?
[Nevantos]Nevantos is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.
	My teammates and their flawless play!
[Nevantos]This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?
	I heard that the bath products on Earth are the best in the universe.
[Nevantos]Nevantos says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	That's bad. I'm sure it's something important!
[Nevantos]The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.
	I can't stand this...I need to end this quickly and go take a shower.
[Nevantos]Nevantos seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	The eyepatch...I wonder if she washes it. She seems to have it on at all times.
[Nevantos]Ogre's pony tail slapped Nevantos in the face!
	Ugh...Gross...
[Nevantos]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.
[Nevantos]Nevantos is suddenly showing massive improvement in his performance. He must've learned something during a match.
	You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.
[Nevantos]Nevantos says that the Swirlies are missing.
	I evolved them.
[Nevantos]Nevantos says he forgot to use his skill points before entering the match. What should we say to him?
	That's unacceptable!
[Nevantos]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	Ugh...I want to dig my eyes out.
[Nevantos]Nevantos picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Let's contact her and return this.
[Nevantos]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	Well, now what?
[Nevantos]Nevantos is irritated because his opponent has the attribute advantage over him.
	Do I have to stop the match?
[Nevantos]Nevantos thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Hmm, her tail is a bit weird and her ears are definitely human...

[Nevantos]Nevantos is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	The other team went home crying!
[Nevantos]This was the worst game in your entire life...Nevantos comes to you to cheer you up.
	Thanks...I know you're the one that's the most devastated...Let's do better next time.
[Nevantos]You're talking to Nevantos about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow. Let's tell him your answer.
	Hmm, there's a guy I'd like to beat up before I die.
[Nevantos]Nevantos is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to him.
	It's only a sport! The strongest team wins, and we are strong!
[Nevantos]Nevantos is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give him some advice.
	Make the scouters fall in love with your performance!
[Nevantos]Nevantos isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. He feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
	We may have to go rough on the team and make them realize the problem.
[Nevantos]With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Nevantos for solutions.
	We won't be able to win the league if we fail to overcome this. 
[Nevantos]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	We're going to hunt that manager down and take back our money. We will show no mercy!
[Nevantos]You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Nevantos and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest. 
	There's no time for tears! Find out who did this and bring justice!
[Nevantos]Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
	The stage is so majestic! It's awesome!
[Nevantos]According to Nevantos's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
	William doesn't know how to respect his seniors.
[Nevantos]Nevantos thinks he knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
	...Sometimes, the truth is better to be left a secret.
[Nevantos]Nevantos won a trip around the world from a radio event!
	What about soccer? You'll have to go through me to go on that trip!
[Nevantos]Nevantos suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.
	This is a good chance to show the baby angels how rough soccer can be!
[Nevantos]The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.
	Care to receive the ball with your face?
[Nevantos]You're sick and in bed when Nevantos and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?
	You guys...I'm about to cry...
[Nevantos]The match and the concert that Nevantos was looking for start at the same time...
	Channel that sorrow and rage towards your opponents and make them pay.
[Nevantos]Nevantos wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
	Maybe he just wants to duke it out.
[Nevantos]MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
	Stop right there!
[Nevantos]The match started and Nevantos is standing still doing nothing.
	Run! Just start running!

[Nia]Nia is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	They were a worthy opponent.
[Nia]This was the worst game in your entire life...Nia comes to you to cheer you up.
	Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.
[Nia]You're talking to Nia about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow. Let's tell her your answer.
	I would say goodbye to all my friends.
[Nia]Nia is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.
	I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
[Nia]Nia is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.
	Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
[Nia]Nia isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
	Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.
[Nia]With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Nia for solutions.
	I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
[Nia]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.
[Nia]You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Nia and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest. 
	Let's give her some space.
[Nia]Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
	This proves that even the aliens like Nari.
[Nia]According to Nia's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
	I thought they were just friends.
[Nia]Nia thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
	First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal. 
[Nia]Nia won a trip around the world from a radio event!
	Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.
[Nia]Nia suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.
	That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.
[Nia]The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.
	Let's see what you have to say after the match.
[Nia]You're sick and in bed when Nia and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?
	I'm sorry...I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...
[Nia]The match and the concert that Nia was looking for start at the same time...
	I'm sorry that you couldn't go.
[Nia]Nia wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
	Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.
[Nia]MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
	Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?
[Nia]The match started and Nia is standing still doing nothing.
	Looks like we'll have to do without her.

[Nia]You find Nia depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.
	It's not your fault that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!
[Nia]Nia is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.
	Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes. You're a precious part of this team.
[Nia]You come across Nia being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.
	Don't use that ability on the field...
[Nia]Nia is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.
	Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes, will you?
[Nia]Nia is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.
	I'll sleep by your side tonight.
[Nia]Nia is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.
[Nia]Nia seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	Perfect! No mistakes made!
[Nia]You come across Nia who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?
	I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.
[Nia]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.
[Nia]You're watching the storm with Nia and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!
[Nia]Nia looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.
[Nia]Nia's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Nia seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	I think that player likes you.
[Nia]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Nia.
	You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.
[Nia]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!
[Nia]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Nia and her opponent isn't over yet.
	Hey! The match is over!
[Nia]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Nia do?
	(Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.)
[Nia]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.
[Nia]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Nia. What should you say?
	Well, you're as cute as Nia.
[Nia]Nia is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Don't come over here! It's dangerous!
[Nia]Latios is chatting with Nia after the match. Let's barge in.
	Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's our pretty girl.

[Niarose]You find Niarose depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.
	You did well and I thank you for that.
[Niarose]Niarose is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.
	That's why I need your help.
[Niarose]You come across Niarose being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.
	Are you feeling alright?
[Niarose]Niarose is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.

	Littre will be fine.
[Niarose]Niarose's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Niarose seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	That player is just messing with you.
[Niarose]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Niarose.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Niarose]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.

	They will never learn with an attitude like that.
[Niarose]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Niarose. What should you say?
	Well, Niarose does have that kind of charm.
[Niarose]Niarose is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Can you peel this guy off of me?
[Niarose]Latios is chatting with Niarose after the match. Let's barge in.
	I'm looking forward to our next match!

[Niarose]Niarose seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.
	It's just a myth. Forget about it.
[Niarose]With a serious face, Niarose is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.
	Well, I'm sure we'll get an answer when we get to the end of this.
[Niarose]Niarose came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	Let's work up a solution.
[Niarose]Niarose is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.
	They support us from the shadows.
[Niarose]The team is having a good run and Niarose is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.
[Niarose]Niarose seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.
[Niarose]Niarose seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.
	Maybe if you increase your Strength...
[Niarose]Niarose is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.
	Flawless skills.
[Niarose]Niarose is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	It's surprising to see such advanced technology.
[Niarose]Niarose plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	We'll see about it after the League.
[Niarose]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Niarose and talk about what to do.
	Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.
[Niarose]Niarose seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.
	I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.
[Niarose]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!
[Niarose]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	I guess he's happy this is a good match.
[Niarose]Niarose's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?
	If you keep it up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.
[Niarose]During a match, Niarose bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?
	We have to keep on going.
[Niarose]Niarose is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.
	Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.
[Niarose]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.
[Niarose]Niarose is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.
[Niarose]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Niarose is starting to get intimidated.
	This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.

[Noa]Noa is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell her?
	Best of 4 should be our goal.
[Noa]Noa is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I think that being able to understand each other is the most important.
[Noa]Noa seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
	It's within our grasp.
[Noa]Noa is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing any problems.
	The honor of our opponent is also important.
[Noa]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some advice.
	Be true to yourself.
[Noa]Noa is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.
	I'm sure you're going to become an intergalactic fool.
[Noa]Noa is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to her.
	We must have faith in the Gate Keepers and win the Galaxy League.
[Noa]Noa is making a scene. She'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.
	Are you giving up before putting up a fight?
[Noa]Noa is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.
	This needs to be analyzed and fixed. Can you help me?
[Noa]Noa is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to her?
	No, it's not boring.
[Noa]It's before the 2nd half, and Noa is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.
	Don't give up until the end.
[Noa]You forgot to lock Noa and almost used her as training material! She looks very upset!
	It's my fault.
[Noa]Noa is confused that she won the MVP. What should you tell her?
	You deserve it. Well done!
[Noa]Noa is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	I would've been doing something to save the universe.
[Noa]The team is saying bad things about Noa for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
	Do you really think that she would skip practice?
[Noa]Noa is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	I can feel the strength of that majestic creature.
[Noa]Noa seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to her. 
	Let's go look for her.
[Noa]On a day off, Noa is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
	I'd love to have a stable job first.
[Noa]Noa is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I just don't want to waste a single day in my life.)
[Noa]There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?
	Let's split up and find the uniforms.

[Noa]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Noa asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!
[Noa]Noa suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!
[Noa]Noa is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.
	(Put your thumbs up, wink, and send a juicy smile.)
[Noa]Noa has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.
	Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it. You should keep that going.
[Noa]As Noa said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.
	It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.
[Noa]The crowd is cheering for Noa. Noa seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.
	They're all in love with your enthusiastic play.
[Noa]Noa is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.
	I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!
[Noa]Noa was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.
	We can play soccer with the penguins!
[Noa]The team will not have a match for some time. Noa asks you about your plan.
	We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.
[Noa]It's a very intense match and Noa falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Noa up and the two exchange smiles.
	True sportsmanship! Wonderful!
[Noa]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.
[Noa]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Noa having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	Save the energy for the match.
[Noa]Noa is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.
	The fans love your performance!
[Noa]Noa scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!
	You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!
[Noa]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Noa.
	I feel like he's mocking us!
[Noa]Noa falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?
	Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!
[Noa]Noa lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	I will avenge you!
[Noa]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Noa. Let's talk to her.
	We'll win next time!
[Noa]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Noa is curious and wants to take a look.
	Let's go help them!
[Noa]Noa brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	Drink it up!

[Noa]Noa is asking you what you think is it that makes this team great. You weren't expecting this, but you should give her an answer.
	You. I know you're doing much for the team without taking any credit.
[Noa]Noa is angry because she was criticized by her performance and is asking your opinion. Let's give her an answer.
	I want to practice with you, if that's okay with you. No?
[Noa]Noa, who has shown absolutely superb chemistry with you, is embarrassed and says she didn't do all of that because of you. What should we say?
	Yeah? Well, I did what I did for you.
[Noa]Noa wants to have an academic conversation about the 5th dimension, string theory, and other infamously hard space theories. Why...?
	(Maybe she brought snacks but is too shy to share it with me.)
[Noa]Noa looks disappointed about the size of the Galaxy League. What would be an appropriate response?
	Nervous? Trust me. I got you.
[Noa]Noa seems to be uncomfortable to hear about the love life of other teammates. Let's talk to her.
	Should we join the club?
[Noa]Noa is talking about how famous her rivals are in the Galaxy League. She seems jealous. Let's talk to her.
	I'll be your rival from now.

	I'm sure you're going to become an intergalactic fool.
[Odin]Odin is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to her.

[Odin]Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Odin is asking how she did in the match.
	You bring the best out of the team. Good work!

[Odin]Odin feels her heart races when she sees Littre.
	...Do you want a Superb Power-up?

	I'm not sure if it's safe, but we can use him for leveling up.
[Odin]Odin continues to charge into the opponent's defense line and keeps failing. What should we do?
	(Make a strategic decision.)

	(Kick her out of the team if things can't be handled.)

	(Tell her that carrots are good for the body and to eat it all.)
[Odin]It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking up for the morning training. What should we tell Odin to do?
	They all need scolding.
[Odin]Odin says that the soup tastes funny. What should we do?
	Let's stay away from the soup, just in case.
[Odin]Odin is furious about the referee that's clearly favoring the other team. Should we stop her?

	It's the place of dreams colliding.
[Ogre]Ogre wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?

	Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!
[Ogre]Ogre is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give him an opinion.
	Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!
[Ogre]Ogre is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.

[Ogre]Ogre's pony tail slapped Ogre in the face!
	That must hurt.
[Ogre]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
[Ogre]Ogre is suddenly showing massive improvement in his performance. He must've learned something during a match.
	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[Ogre]Ogre says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[Ogre]Ogre says he forgot to use his skill points before entering the match. What should we say to him?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[Ogre]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Ogre]Ogre picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[Ogre]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Ogre]Ogre is irritated because his opponent has the attribute advantage over him.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[Ogre]Ogre thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

	Let's make that our goal and make it happen.

	The eyepatch...I wonder if she washes it. She seems to have it on at all times.
[Pinol]Ogre's pony tail slapped Pinol in the face!
	Ugh...Gross...
[Pinol]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.
[Pinol]Pinol is suddenly showing massive improvement in his performance. He must've learned something during a match.
	You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.
[Pinol]Pinol says that the Swirlies are missing.
	I evolved them.
[Pinol]Pinol says he forgot to use his skill points before entering the match. What should we say to him?

[Pinol]Pinol picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Let's contact her and return this.
[Pinol]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	Well, now what?
[Pinol]Pinol is irritated because his opponent has the attribute advantage over him.

[Pinol]Pinol thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Hmm, her tail is a bit weird and her ears are definitely human...

[Pinol]Pinol is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	I led our team to victory with wedgies!
[Pinol]This was the worst game in your entire life...Pinol comes to you to cheer you up.
	Please explain why you kicked the ball into our goal post, will you?

	If it's the end of the world, I'd pull of a crazy performance in a densely populated area before I go!

	Aren't you the one everybody should be afraid of?

	How about we put that advanced technology of Metro City to use?
[Pinol]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	We could start a reset marathon.
[Pinol]You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Pinol and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.

[Pinol]Pinol won a trip around the world from a radio event!
	...World? What about space? Isn't that more interesting?
[Pinol]Pinol suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.
	What's the agenda here? Are you trying to taint the pure angels?
[Pinol]The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.
	I didn't know I was a talented foot volleyball player!
[Pinol]You're sick and in bed when Pinol and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?
	Get closer so I can spread my germs!
[Pinol]The match and the concert that Pinol was looking for start at the same time...
	Let's hack the big screen so we can see the concert!
[Pinol]Pinol wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
	The character story left him a trauma.
[Pinol]MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
	...Maybe he just likes cats!
[Pinol]The match started and Pinol is standing still doing nothing.
	What is he doing? Is he a totem?

[Presty]Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Presty is asking how she did in the match.
	You bring the best out of the team. Good work!
[Presty]Presty looks excited as she's talking with the team about pets. She turns around and asks you what kind of pet you like.
	I think that a baby duck following its mother is one of the most adorable things to watch.

	The field is a ground of hopes and dreams. Isn't that enough?

[Presty]Presty feels her heart races when she sees Littre.
	...Do you want a Superb Power-up?

	Let's stay away from the soup, just in case.
[Presty]Presty is furious about the referee that's clearly favoring the other team. Should we stop her?
	Ignore the referee. Focus on the match.
[Presty]It suddenly began to rain heavily. You see Presty running up ahead.
	(Catch up and share your umbrella.)
[Presty]You witnessed a player on the other side putting a tack in Presty's shoe.
	(Remove the tack and tell the manager on the other team.)
[Presty]During the team meeting, you find a player sleeping. What should you do?
	(Wake the player up and continue with the meeting.)
[Presty]Presty hurt her leg during the 1st half of the match, but she insists on playing. What should we tell her?
	Don't push yourself too hard. There are a lot of matches left.

	It's not your fault that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!

[Presty]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.
[Presty]You're watching the storm with Presty and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.

	Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.

	Well, you're as cute as Presty.
[Presty]Presty is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Don't come over here! It's dangerous!
[Presty]Latios is chatting with Presty after the match. Let's barge in.
	Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's our pretty girl.

	Yeah, they get along pretty well.
[Rasia]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Rasia hands you a present.
	(A cute and pretty pendant)
[Rasia]Rasia says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.
	I think she likes him.

[Rasiel]Rasiel is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell her?
	Best of 4 should be our goal.
[Rasiel]Rasiel is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I think that being able to understand each other is the most important.
[Rasiel]Rasiel seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
	It's within our grasp.
[Rasiel]Rasiel is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing any problems.
	The honor of our opponent is also important.
[Rasiel]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some advice.
	Be true to yourself.
[Rasiel]Rasiel is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.
	I'm sure you're going to become an intergalactic fool.
[Rasiel]Rasiel is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to her.
	We must have faith in the Gate Keepers and win the Galaxy League.
[Rasiel]Rasiel is making a scene. She'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.
	Are you giving up before putting up a fight?
[Rasiel]Rasiel is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.
	This needs to be analyzed and fixed. Can you help me?
[Rasiel]Rasiel is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to her?
	No, it's not boring.
[Rasiel]It's before the 2nd half, and Rasiel is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.
	Don't give up until the end.
[Rasiel]You forgot to lock Rasiel and almost used her as training material! She looks very upset!
	It's my fault.
[Rasiel]Rasiel is confused that she won the MVP. What should you tell her?
	You deserve it. Well done!
[Rasiel]Rasiel is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	I would've been doing something to save the universe.
[Rasiel]The team is saying bad things about Rasiel for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
	Do you really think that she would skip practice?
[Rasiel]Rasiel is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	I can feel the strength of that majestic creature.
[Rasiel]Rasiel seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to her. 
	Let's go look for her.
[Rasiel]On a day off, Rasiel is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
	I'd love to have a stable job first.
[Rasiel]Rasiel is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I just don't want to waste a single day in my life.)
[Rasiel]There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?
	Let's split up and find the uniforms.

[Rasiel]Rasiel says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?
	Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.
[Rasiel]Rasiel asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give her a sincere answer.
	I'm going to make a joke before I start crying!
[Rasiel]Rasiel is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.
	Do you think they'll be tasty?
[Rasiel]Rasiel looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?
	Do you think any of those comets are populated?
[Rasiel]Rasiel says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.
	Teach them how adults play soccer.
[Rasiel]Rasiel wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.
	Beginner level monsters in an RPG game.
[Rasiel]Rasiel is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.
	That's deep. I think it's cool.
[Rasiel]Rasiel says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.
[Rasiel]Rasiel says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry.
[Rasiel]Rasiel seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?
	Don't forget that we exist! Haha!
[Rasiel]Rasiel is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?
	Please don't forget about the match.
[Rasiel]Rasiel says she's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.
	Is her name really Kiki?
[Rasiel]Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Rasiel seems to be troubled. What should we do?
	If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?
[Rasiel]Rasiel is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.
[Rasiel]Rasiel went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	We should think about how to make fun of her when she comes back.
[Rasiel]Rasiel claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	Maybe Sophie is actually a male...?
[Rasiel]Rasiel seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?
[Rasiel]Rasiel says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.
[Rasiel]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Rasiel hands you a present.
	(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)
[Rasiel]Rasiel says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.
	Maybe she's up to something.

[Ravian]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Ravian asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	What, are you expecting something like ''I feel like I can fly'' or something?
[Ravian]Ravian suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.
[Ravian]Ravian is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.
	(Just nod your head.)
[Ravian]Ravian has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.
	You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.
[Ravian]As Ravian said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.
	I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.
[Ravian]The crowd is cheering for Ravian. Ravian seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.
	How about just accepting the compliments for today?
[Ravian]Ravian is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.
	The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.
[Ravian]Ravian was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.
	It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!
[Ravian]The team will not have a match for some time. Ravian asks you about your plan.
	I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.
[Ravian]It's a very intense match and Ravian falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Ravian up and the two exchange smiles.
	Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?
[Ravian]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.
[Ravian]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Ravian having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	...I see two idiots standing in front of me...
[Ravian]Ravian is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.
	I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.
[Ravian]Ravian scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!
	That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!
[Ravian]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Ravian.
	He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.
[Ravian]Ravian falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?
	If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.
[Ravian]Ravian lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...
[Ravian]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Ravian. Let's talk to her.
	(Ignore.)
[Ravian]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Ravian is curious and wants to take a look.
	We should probably ignore them and just walk by.
[Ravian]Ravian brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	Throw it away. NOW.

[Ravian]Ravian seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.
	Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.
[Ravian]With a serious face, Ravian is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.
	Being together is enough for me.
[Ravian]Ravian came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.
[Ravian]Ravian is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.
	Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?
[Ravian]The team is having a good run and Ravian is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	Let's keep this momentum going!
[Ravian]Ravian seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	Let's open up a bright future with this ball.
[Ravian]Ravian seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.
	Don't be weak.
[Ravian]Ravian is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.
	Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.
[Ravian]Ravian is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.
[Ravian]Ravian plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.
[Ravian]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Ravian and talk about what to do.
	We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.
[Ravian]Ravian seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.
	I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great. 
[Ravian]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	...Uh...So no soccer?
[Ravian]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!
[Ravian]Ravian's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?
	Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.
[Ravian]During a match, Ravian bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?
	It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.
[Ravian]Ravian is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.
	It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.
[Ravian]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.
[Ravian]Ravian is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.
[Ravian]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Ravian is starting to get intimidated.
	Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.

[Ravian]Ravian is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.
	We need a decent level of personal performance.
[Ravian]Ravian, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've never dreamt about soccer.
[Ravian]Ravian announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	I have faith in you.
[Ravian]Ravian is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
	That doesn't change what we must do.
[Ravian]Ravian wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
	Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
[Ravian]It seems that Ravian is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Ravian? Nah, she never gets lost.
[Ravian]You find Ravian lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[Ravian]Ravian says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
[Ravian]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[Ravian]Ravian wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
[Ravian]Ravian caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[Ravian]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Ravian some orders.
	Let's try out some forward passes.
[Ravian]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	It's time we use him as training material.
[Ravian]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Ravian seems to be worried.
	It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.
[Ravian]Ravian came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I hope that wasn't all you got.
[Ravian]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...We should get out of here.
[Ravian]Ravian is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.

[Ray]Ray is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	The other team went home crying!
[Ray]This was the worst game in your entire life...Ray comes to you to cheer you up.
	Thanks...I know you're the one that's the most devastated...Let's do better next time.
[Ray]You're talking to Ray about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow. Let's tell him your answer.
	Hmm, there's a guy I'd like to beat up before I die.
[Ray]Ray is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to him.
	It's only a sport! The strongest team wins, and we are strong!
[Ray]Ray is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give him some advice.
	Make the scouters fall in love with your performance!
[Ray]Ray isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. He feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
	We may have to go rough on the team and make them realize the problem.

	We won't be able to win the league if we fail to overcome this.

[Ray]Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
	The stage is so majestic! It's awesome!
[Ray]According to Ray's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.

[Ray]Ray thinks he knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
	...Sometimes, the truth is better to be left a secret.
[Ray]Ray won a trip around the world from a radio event!
	What about soccer? You'll have to go through me to go on that trip!
[Ray]Ray suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.
	This is a good chance to show the baby angels how rough soccer can be!
[Ray]The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.
	Care to receive the ball with your face?
[Ray]You're sick and in bed when Ray and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?
	You guys...I'm about to cry...
[Ray]The match and the concert that Ray was looking for start at the same time...
	Channel that sorrow and rage towards your opponents and make them pay.
[Ray]Ray wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
	Maybe he just wants to duke it out.

[Roina]Roina is having trouble focusing on the match. Let's help her out.

[Roina]It's Roina's birthday. Let's give her a present.
	Here! I made some cookies with the team.
[Roina]You see Roina's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Roina. What should we do?

[Roina]The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?
	I guess I can go to the soccer gear shop.

	There will always be a place for you to return.

	We can overcome this with team effort.
[Roina]Roina is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.
	I'm sure there were multiple reasons on why the kingdom fell. It's sad to hear such stories.

	We're going to make it fair and gather everybody around so we can draw for the ticket.
[Roina]Roina says she wants to cry because the goal keeper on the other team just won't go down no matter how many shots she makes.
	I'll come up with a formation that can bring the best out of everybody.

[Ronald]It's a very intense match and Ronald falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Ronald up and the two exchange smiles.
	That player must have a heart of gold.
[Ronald]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.

	They must love volunteer work!

	We won't be able to win the league if we fail to overcome this.

	There's no time for tears! Find out who did this and bring justice!
[Ronald]Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
	The stage is so majestic! It's awesome!
[Ronald]According to Ronald's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
	William doesn't know how to respect his seniors.
[Ronald]Ronald thinks he knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
	...Sometimes, the truth is better to be left a secret.
[Ronald]Ronald won a trip around the world from a radio event!
	What about soccer? You'll have to go through me to go on that trip!
[Ronald]Ronald suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.
	This is a good chance to show the baby angels how rough soccer can be!

	Care to receive the ball with your face?

	I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.

[Rosaria]Rosaria is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing any problems.
	You're right. This is a waste of time.
[Rosaria]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some advice.
	I don't see anything wrong as long as you can get away with it.

	I want one of those. It'll be fun to have a pet dragon.

	A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?

	Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)
[Rosaria]Rosaria seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.
	Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.
[Rosaria]Rosaria is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.
	Well, having a good ace skill is a start.

	Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.
[Rosaria]Rosaria plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	I'm thinking of opening a shop.
[Rosaria]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Rosaria and talk about what to do.
	I hope they have a ''Continue'' button around here.
[Rosaria]Rosaria seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.
	Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!
[Rosaria]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	Cool! Awesome!
[Rosaria]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?

	Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.

	Wasn't that a glitch?
[Rosaria]Rosaria is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.
	I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.
[Rosaria]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.
[Rosaria]Rosaria is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.
[Rosaria]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Rosaria is starting to get intimidated.

	Nicely done! We're throwing a party today!
[Rudy]Rudy is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	Something full of excitement!
[Rudy]The team is saying bad things about Rudy for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
	Her love towards soccer is real.
[Rudy]Rudy is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	I want one of those. It'll be fun to have a pet dragon.
[Rudy]Rudy seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to her. 
	It'll be alright. Don't worry.
[Rudy]On a day off, Rudy is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
	If you find a handsome man, try talking to him!
[Rudy]Rudy is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I want every day to be exciting and fun.)
[Rudy]There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?
	It's finally time for some festival-soccer!

[Rudy]Rudy says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?
	Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.
[Rudy]Rudy asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give her a sincere answer.
	I'm going to make a joke before I start crying!
[Rudy]Rudy is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.
	Do you think they'll be tasty?
[Rudy]Rudy looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?
	Do you think any of those comets are populated?
[Rudy]Rudy says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.
	Teach them how adults play soccer.
[Rudy]Rudy wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.
	Beginner level monsters in an RPG game.
[Rudy]Rudy is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.
	That's deep. I think it's cool.
[Rudy]Rudy says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.
[Rudy]Rudy says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry.
[Rudy]Rudy seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?
	Don't forget that we exist! Haha!
[Rudy]Rudy is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?
	Please don't forget about the match.
[Rudy]Rudy says she's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.
	Is her name really Kiki?
[Rudy]Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Rudy seems to be troubled. What should we do?
	If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?
[Rudy]Rudy is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.
[Rudy]Rudy went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	We should think about how to make fun of her when she comes back.
[Rudy]Rudy claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	Maybe Sophie is actually a male...?
[Rudy]Rudy seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?
[Rudy]Rudy says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.
[Rudy]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Rudy hands you a present.
	(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)
[Rudy]Rudy says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.
	Maybe she's up to something.

[Ruen]Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Ruen is asking how she did in the match.
	You bring the best out of the team. Good work!
[Ruen]Ruen looks excited as she's talking with the team about pets. She turns around and asks you what kind of pet you like.
	I think that a baby duck following its mother is one of the most adorable things to watch.
[Ruen]You come across Ruen thinking about the value of soccer. What should we tell her?
	The field is a ground of hopes and dreams. Isn't that enough?
[Ruen]Ruen is having trouble focusing on the match because of the affectionate emotion she feels. She says she must leave now to propose to her lover. What should we say?
	Think about your teammates that are counting on you.
[Ruen]Ruen blushes up and tells you that she's happy she can play soccer with you. What should we tell her?
	Me too. You're a good leader.
[Ruen]Ruen is asking for special training sessions because she's not satisfied with today's performance. What should we tell her?
	If that's your wish.
[Ruen]Ruen did her best, but she failed to achieve the results she wanted and looks sad. We should say something to her.
	It's experiences like this that bonds us together.
[Ruen]Ruen is asking you about what you like besides soccer.
	I like board games about war. I admire famous commanders.
[Ruen]Ruen feels her heart races when she sees Littre.
	...Do you want a Superb Power-up?
[Ruen]Kuma is caught sneaking in the woman's locker room once again. We should talk with Ruen about what to do with him.
	I'm not sure if it's safe, but we can use him for leveling up.
[Ruen]Ruen continues to charge into the opponent's defense line and keeps failing. What should we do?
	(Make a strategic decision.)
[Ruen]Ruen is being annoying with her offensive words. What should we do?
	(Kick her out of the team if things can't be handled.)
[Ruen]It's dinner time and Ruen is staring at her carrot soup with a troubled look. What should we do?
	(Tell her that carrots are good for the body and to eat it all.)
[Ruen]It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking up for the morning training. What should we tell Ruen to do?
	They all need scolding.
[Ruen]Ruen says that the soup tastes funny. What should we do?
	Let's stay away from the soup, just in case.
[Ruen]Ruen is furious about the referee that's clearly favoring the other team. Should we stop her?
	Ignore the referee. Focus on the match.
[Ruen]It suddenly began to rain heavily. You see Ruen running up ahead.
	(Catch up and share your umbrella.)
[Ruen]You witnessed a player on the other side putting a tack in Ruen's shoe.
	(Remove the tack and tell the manager on the other team.)
[Ruen]During the team meeting, you find a player sleeping. What should you do?
	(Wake the player up and continue with the meeting.)
[Ruen]Ruen hurt her leg during the 1st half of the match, but she insists on playing. What should we tell her?
	Don't push yourself too hard. There are a lot of matches left.

[Ryle]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Ryle asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	Wow. I'm sooooo happy.
[Ryle]Ryle suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.
[Ryle]Ryle is saying that his teammates are what keeps him going.
	(Pat him on the head.)
[Ryle]Ryle has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. He is asking for your evaluation on his plays. Let's give him an answer.
	I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.
[Ryle]As Ryle said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to him.
	I'm sure it's going in a good direction.
[Ryle]The crowd is cheering for Ryle. Ryle seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help him out.
	They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.
[Ryle]Ryle is impressed by the help he received from the elementals. Let's talk to him.
	I am so thankful to them.
[Ryle]Ryle was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin himself. Let's talk to him.
	Oh, that'll be so cute!
[Ryle]The team will not have a match for some time. Ryle asks you about your plan.
	Hmm, wanna go shopping?
[Ryle]It's a very intense match and Ryle falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Ryle up and the two exchange smiles.
	That player must have a heart of gold.
[Ryle]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
[Ryle]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Ryle having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?
[Ryle]Ryle is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to him.
	Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.
[Ryle]Ryle scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate him!
	Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?
[Ryle]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Ryle.
	It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.
[Ryle]Ryle falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to him?
	Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.
[Ryle]Ryle lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	This doesn't look good...Can anybody give him some heals?
[Ryle]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Ryle. Let's talk to her.
	Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.
[Ryle]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Ryle is curious and wants to take a look.
	They must love volunteer work!
[Ryle]Ryle brought a drink that he says he received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...

[Ryle]Ryle is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	They were a worthy opponent.
[Ryle]This was the worst game in your entire life...Ryle comes to you to cheer you up.
	Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.
[Ryle]You're talking to Ryle about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow. Let's tell him your answer.
	I would say goodbye to all my friends.
[Ryle]Ryle is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to him.
	I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
[Ryle]Ryle is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give him some advice.
	Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
[Ryle]Ryle isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. He feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
	Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.
[Ryle]With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Ryle for solutions.
	I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
[Ryle]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.
[Ryle]You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Ryle and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest. 
	Let's give her some space.
[Ryle]Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
	This proves that even the aliens like Nari.
[Ryle]According to Ryle's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
	I thought they were just friends.
[Ryle]Ryle thinks he knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
	First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal. 
[Ryle]Ryle won a trip around the world from a radio event!
	Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.
[Ryle]Ryle suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.
	That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.
[Ryle]The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.
	Let's see what you have to say after the match.
[Ryle]You're sick and in bed when Ryle and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?
	I'm sorry...I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...
[Ryle]The match and the concert that Ryle was looking for start at the same time...
	I'm sorry that you couldn't go.
[Ryle]Ryle wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
	Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.
[Ryle]MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
	Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?
[Ryle]The match started and Ryle is standing still doing nothing.
	Looks like we'll have to do without him.

[Ryu]Ryu is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	They were a worthy opponent.
[Ryu]This was the worst game in your entire life...Ryu comes to you to cheer you up.

[Ryu]Ryu is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give him an answer.
	We need a decent level of personal performance.
[Ryu]Ryu, who is determined to make everything in his life, even his dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've never dreamt about soccer.
[Ryu]Ryu announces that he will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give him an answer.
	I have faith in you.
[Ryu]Ryu is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to him?
	That doesn't change what we must do.
[Ryu]Ryu wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. He wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to him.
	Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
[Ryu]It seems that Ryu is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Ryu? Nah, he never gets lost.
[Ryu]You find Ryu lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[Ryu]Ryu says he doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. He thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
[Ryu]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[Ryu]Ryu wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
[Ryu]Ryu caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[Ryu]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Ryu some orders.
	Let's try out some forward passes.
[Ryu]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	It's time we use him as training material.
[Ryu]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Ryu seems to be worried.
	It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.
[Ryu]Ryu came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I hope that wasn't all you got.
[Ryu]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...We should get out of here.
[Ryu]Ryu is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer him up?
	It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
[Ryu]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Ryu seems to be sick of this.
	Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
[Ryu]Ryu looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	It's space. Anything can exist here.
[Ryu]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Ryu to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

[Sage]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Sage asks how you feel. How should we answer?

[Sage]Sage is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.

[Sage]Sage is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to him.
	It's just a dream. Forget about it.
[Sage]Sage is stressed out saying his opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	You can overcome this like always. Right?
[Sage]Sage seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to him.
	I'm starting to see true strength in this team.
[Sage]You come across Sage who is limping. He says it's nothing. What should we do?
	Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.
[Sage]You visit Merlin's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Can't you cook ramen by yourself?
[Sage]You're watching the storm with Sage and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	What's wrong with her?
[Sage]Sage looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Littre will be fine.
[Sage]Sage's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Sage seems to be nervous. Let's talk to him.
	That player is just messing with you.
[Sage]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Sage.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Sage]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's give them a hand.
[Sage]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Sage and his opponent isn't over yet.
	You better win that fight!
[Sage]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Sage do?
	(Let him take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)
[Sage]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	They will never learn with an attitude like that.
[Sage]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Sage. What should you say?
	Well, Sage does have that kind of charm.
[Sage]Sage is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Can you peel this guy off of me?
[Sage]Latios is chatting with Sage after the match. Let's barge in.
	I'm looking forward to our next match!

[Saramir]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Saramir is curious and wants to take a look.
	They must love volunteer work!

	All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.
[Saunier]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Saunier is starting to get intimidated.

	It's silly of you to worry about such things. Are you feeling okay?
[Sean]Sean is making a scene. He'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.
	The door's over there.
[Sean]Sean is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.
	It can't be perfect every time.
[Sean]Sean is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to him?
	How about we play baseball today?
[Sean]It's before the 2nd half, and Sean is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.
	There's nothing we can really do. Let's just get this over with.
[Sean]You forgot to lock Sean and almost used him as training material! He looks very upset!
	It's your fault.
[Sean]Sean is confused that he won the MVP. What should you tell him?
	Nicely done! We're throwing a party today!
[Sean]Sean is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	Something full of excitement!
[Sean]The team is saying bad things about Sean for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
	His love towards soccer is real.
[Sean]Sean is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	I want one of those. It'll be fun to have a pet dragon.
[Sean]Sean seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to him. 
	It'll be alright. Don't worry.
[Sean]On a day off, Sean is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
	If you find a beautiful woman, try talking to her!
[Sean]Sean is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I want every day to be exciting and fun.)
[Sean]There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?
	It's finally time for some festival-soccer!

[Sean]Sean is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to him.
	Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.
[Sean]Sean is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help him?
	It's the place of dreams colliding.
[Sean]Sean wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	Why don't you join them and find out?

	Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!
[Sean]Sean is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give him an opinion.
	Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!
[Sean]Sean is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.

	Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.
[Sean]Sean says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	He'll remember someday.

	Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!
[Sean]Sean seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.
[Sean]Ogre's pony tail slapped Sean in the face!
	That must hurt.
[Sean]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
[Sean]Sean is suddenly showing massive improvement in his performance. He must've learned something during a match.
	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[Sean]Sean says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[Sean]Sean says he forgot to use his skill points before entering the match. What should we say to him?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[Sean]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Sean]Sean picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[Sean]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Sean]Sean is irritated because his opponent has the attribute advantage over him.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[Sean]Sean thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[Selpina]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Selpina asks how you feel. How should we answer?

	I'm sure it's going in a good direction.

	They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.
[Selpina]Selpina is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.
	I am so thankful to them.
[Selpina]Selpina was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.

	Hmm, wanna go shopping?
[Selpina]It's a very intense match and Selpina falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Selpina up and the two exchange smiles.
	That player must have a heart of gold.
[Selpina]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
[Selpina]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Selpina having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?
[Selpina]Selpina is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.
	Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.

	Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?

	It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.
[Selpina]Selpina falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?
	Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.
[Selpina]Selpina lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?
[Selpina]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Selpina. Let's talk to her.
	Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.

	They must love volunteer work!
[Selpina]Selpina brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...

[Selpina]Selpina is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.
	We need a decent level of personal performance.
[Selpina]Selpina, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've never dreamt about soccer.
[Selpina]Selpina announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	I have faith in you.
[Selpina]Selpina is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
	That doesn't change what we must do.
[Selpina]Selpina wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
	Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
[Selpina]It seems that Selpina is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Selpina? Nah, she never gets lost.
[Selpina]You find Selpina lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[Selpina]Selpina says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
[Selpina]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[Selpina]Selpina wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
[Selpina]Selpina caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[Selpina]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Selpina some orders.
	Let's try out some forward passes.
[Selpina]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	It's time we use him as training material.
[Selpina]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Selpina seems to be worried.
	It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.
[Selpina]Selpina came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I hope that wasn't all you got.
[Selpina]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...We should get out of here.
[Selpina]Selpina is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
[Selpina]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Selpina seems to be sick of this.
	Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
[Selpina]Selpina looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	It's space. Anything can exist here.
[Selpina]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Selpina to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

[Sena]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Sena asks how you feel. How should we answer?

[Serestia]Serestia is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.

	I'll be your rival from now.

	Are you jealous?
[Shairan]Kirin suddenly appears, pats Shairan on the head while teasing her, and then goes away. Shairan seems angry...
	...I think you liked it more than you thought...
[Shairan]The team is at Metro City. Shairan seems to be surprised how the people of Metro City have mechanical bodies.

	So, the numerous baby clothes you've been making were all for this day?
[Shairan]The team seems very nervous facing Skalardra. What should we do?
	Huh? I think Shairan is prettier.
[Shairan]Shairan refuses to listen to anybody's advice saying he's the best and he doesn't need any advice. Let's talk to her.
	Are you angry because I wasn't there to oversee your training? I said I'm sorry!
[Shairan]Shairan is interested in Selena and is asking for your opinion. What should we say?
	Be honest and show a sincere attitude.

	That's the spirit! Let's teach them a lesson!

	Your spirit is an inspiration to us all.
[Shairan]A teammate that is a former member of the Dark Sisters is down sick, suffering from the aftermath of performing exorcism. Let's talk with Shairan about what to do.
	Let's go visit her. Some fun won't do any harm. It might even cheer her up!

[Shanti]You find Shanti depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.
	You did well and I thank you for that.
[Shanti]Shanti is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.

[Shanti]Shanti is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.

[Shanti]Shanti is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	You can overcome this like always. Right?
[Shanti]Shanti seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	I'm starting to see true strength in this team.
[Shanti]You come across Shanti who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?
	Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.
[Shanti]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Can't you cook ramen by yourself?
[Shanti]You're watching the storm with Shanti and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	What's wrong with her?
[Shanti]Shanti looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Littre will be fine.
[Shanti]Shanti's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Shanti seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	That player is just messing with you.
[Shanti]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Shanti.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Shanti]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's give them a hand.
[Shanti]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Shanti and her opponent isn't over yet.
	You better win that fight!
[Shanti]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Shanti do?
	(Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)
[Shanti]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	They will never learn with an attitude like that.
[Shanti]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Shanti. What should you say?
	Well, Shanti does have that kind of charm.
[Shanti]Shanti is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Can you peel this guy off of me?
[Shanti]Latios is chatting with Shanti after the match. Let's barge in.
	I'm looking forward to our next match!

[Shanti]Shanti is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.
	What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?
[Shanti]Shanti, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.
[Shanti]Shanti announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	You'll have to compete with me!

	It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.
[Shanti]It seems that Shanti is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Listen carefully and you'll find her.
[Shanti]You find Shanti lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!

	Hmm? That is odd...What do you think about this?
[Shanti]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!
[Shanti]Shanti wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	What about just watching?
[Shanti]Shanti caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	You came to see my marvelous moves? I'm flattered. 
[Shanti]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Shanti some orders.
	Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!
[Shanti]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	Stop right there, pig!
[Shanti]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Shanti seems to be worried.
	Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.
[Shanti]Shanti came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?
[Shanti]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...It's about to go down...! Where's the popcorn?
[Shanti]Shanti is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	Who could've done such a hideous thing?
[Shanti]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Shanti seems to be sick of this.
	Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Shanti!
[Shanti]Shanti looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	How about we ask Jeunese?
[Shanti]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Shanti to set some simple rules.
	Come on, I'll show you the best spots around!

[Sharr]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Sharr asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	What, are you expecting something like ''I feel like I can fly'' or something?
[Sharr]Sharr suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.
[Sharr]Sharr is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.
	(Just nod your head.)
[Sharr]Sharr has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.
	You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.
[Sharr]As Sharr said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.
	I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.
[Sharr]The crowd is cheering for Sharr. Sharr seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.
	How about just accepting the compliments for today?
[Sharr]Sharr is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.
	The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.
[Sharr]Sharr was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.
	It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!
[Sharr]The team will not have a match for some time. Sharr asks you about your plan.
	I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.
[Sharr]It's a very intense match and Sharr falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Sharr up and the two exchange smiles.
	Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?
[Sharr]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.
[Sharr]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Sharr having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	...I see two idiots standing in front of me...
[Sharr]Sharr is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.
	I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.
[Sharr]Sharr scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!
	That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!
[Sharr]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Sharr.
	He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.
[Sharr]Sharr falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?
	If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.
[Sharr]Sharr lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...
[Sharr]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Sharr. Let's talk to her.
	(Ignore.)
[Sharr]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Sharr is curious and wants to take a look.
	We should probably ignore them and just walk by.
[Sharr]Sharr brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	Throw it away. NOW.

[Sharr]Sharr says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?
	I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.
[Sharr]Sharr asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give her a sincere answer.
	I guess I'll be chasing you on the road of glory.
[Sharr]Sharr is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.
	I think they're cute and elegant if you leave out the pig and bear. 
[Sharr]Sharr looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?
	The space has prepared this beautiful stage for you.
[Sharr]Sharr says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.
	They're young but they have passion.
[Sharr]Sharr wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.
	Thankful beings that will be our +160.
[Sharr]Sharr is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.
	How about we make it to the top of the Galaxy League and shine the universe with the light within us?
[Sharr]Sharr says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	Tell them they should remember that they play for you.
[Sharr]Sharr says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	Did she think that you'll take over the throne?
[Sharr]Sharr seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?
	Good for you! I know it's hard for you to find someone at your level!
[Sharr]Sharr is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?
	I don't think you need to worry about a diet.
[Sharr]Sharr says she's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.
	Ask her if she likes you and if she wants to join our team.
[Sharr]Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Sharr seems to be troubled. What should we do?
	You both need to be disciplined by Sharr.
[Sharr]Sharr is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	You seem like the princess...Scratch that, the queen.
[Sharr]Sharr went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	I feel sorry for the other team.
[Sharr]Sharr claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	I don't care what the case is.
[Sharr]Sharr seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	Be careful not to be stomped on...
[Sharr]Sharr says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	That's strange. I thought he was more of an authoritative character.
[Sharr]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Sharr hands you a present.
	(A chocker with a pretty radical design.)
[Sharr]Sharr says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.
	That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy, and love.

[Shu]Shu is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell him?
	To win all the way, of course.
[Shu]Shu is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.
[Shu]Shu seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. He seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
	(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)
[Shu]Shu is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop him from causing any problems.
	You're right. This is a waste of time.
[Shu]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give him some advice.
	I don't see anything wrong as long as you can get away with it.
[Shu]Shu is having trouble deciding a name for his special move. His options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.
	Cool! Keep it up!
[Shu]Shu is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to him.
	It's silly of you to worry about such things. Are you feeling okay?
[Shu]Shu is making a scene. He'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.
	The door's over there.
[Shu]Shu is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.
	It can't be perfect every time.
[Shu]Shu is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to him?
	How about we play baseball today?
[Shu]It's before the 2nd half, and Shu is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.
	There's nothing we can really do. Let's just get this over with.
[Shu]You forgot to lock Shu and almost used him as training material! He looks very upset!
	It's your fault.
[Shu]Shu is confused that he won the MVP. What should you tell him?
	Nicely done! We're throwing a party today!
[Shu]Shu is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	Something full of excitement!
[Shu]The team is saying bad things about Shu for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
	His love towards soccer is real.
[Shu]Shu is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	I want one of those. It'll be fun to have a pet dragon.
[Shu]Shu seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to him. 
	It'll be alright. Don't worry.
[Shu]On a day off, Shu is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
	If you find a beautiful woman, try talking to her!
[Shu]Shu is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I want every day to be exciting and fun.)
[Shu]There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?
	It's finally time for some festival-soccer!

[Shu]Shu seems to be lost after having a good match while his fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to him.
	Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.
[Shu]With a serious face, Shu is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give him an answer.
	Being together is enough for me.
[Shu]Shu came to you after the match, and says he's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.
[Shu]Shu is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.
	Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?
[Shu]The team is having a good run and Shu is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	Let's keep this momentum going!
[Shu]Shu seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	Let's open up a bright future with this ball.
[Shu]Shu seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.
	Don't be weak.
[Shu]Shu is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.
	Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.
[Shu]Shu is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.
[Shu]Shu plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.
	I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.
[Shu]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Shu and talk about what to do.
	We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.
[Shu]Shu seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.
	I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great. 
[Shu]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	...Uh...So no soccer?
[Shu]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!
[Shu]Shu's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next match. What should we say to him?
	Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.
[Shu]During a match, Shu bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?
	It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.
[Shu]Shu is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to him.
	It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.
[Shu]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.
[Shu]Shu is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.
[Shu]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Shu is starting to get intimidated.
	Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.

[Shura]You find Shura depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.
	It's not your fault that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!
[Shura]Shura is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.
	Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes. You're a precious part of this team.
[Shura]You come across Shura being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.
	Don't use that ability on the field...
[Shura]Shura is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.
	Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes, will you?
[Shura]Shura is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.
	I'll sleep by your side tonight.
[Shura]Shura is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.
[Shura]Shura seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	Perfect! No mistakes made!
[Shura]You come across Shura who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?
	I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.
[Shura]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.
[Shura]You're watching the storm with Shura and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!
[Shura]Shura looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.
[Shura]Shura's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Shura seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	I think that player likes you.
[Shura]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Shura.
	You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.
[Shura]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!
[Shura]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Shura and her opponent isn't over yet.
	Hey! The match is over!
[Shura]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Shura do?
	(Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.)
[Shura]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.
[Shura]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Shura. What should you say?
	Well, you're as cute as Shura.
[Shura]Shura is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Don't come over here! It's dangerous!
[Shura]Latios is chatting with Shura after the match. Let's barge in.

	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?

[Skorn]Skorn feels his heart races when he sees Littre.

	We should think about how to make fun of him when he comes back.
[Skorn]Skorn claims he saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?

	Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?

	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[Sorrow]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Sorrow some orders.

[Stella]Stella is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell her?
	To win all the way, of course.
[Stella]Stella is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.
[Stella]Stella seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
	(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)
[Stella]Stella is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing any problems.
	You're right. This is a waste of time.
[Stella]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some advice.
	I don't see anything wrong as long as you can get away with it.

[Stella]Stella is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to her.

	Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it. You should keep that going.

	They're all in love with your enthusiastic play.
[Stella]Stella is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.
	I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!
[Stella]Stella was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.
	We can play soccer with the penguins!
[Stella]The team will not have a match for some time. Stella asks you about your plan.
	We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.
[Stella]It's a very intense match and Stella falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Stella up and the two exchange smiles.
	True sportsmanship! Wonderful!
[Stella]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.

[Sue]Sue caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?

[Sue]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Sue some orders.
	Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!
[Sue]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	Stop right there, pig!
[Sue]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Sue seems to be worried.

[Sue]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!

	The honor of our opponent is also important.
[Tersia]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some advice.
	Be true to yourself.
[Tersia]Tersia is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.
	I'm sure you're going to become an intergalactic fool.
[Tersia]Tersia is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to her.
	We must have faith in the Gate Keepers and win the Galaxy League.
[Tersia]Tersia is making a scene. She'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.
	Are you giving up before putting up a fight?
[Tersia]Tersia is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.
	This needs to be analyzed and fixed. Can you help me?
[Tersia]Tersia is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to her?
	No, it's not boring.
[Tersia]It's before the 2nd half, and Tersia is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.
	Don't give up until the end.
[Tersia]You forgot to lock Tersia and almost used her as training material! She looks very upset!
	It's my fault.
[Tersia]Tersia is confused that she won the MVP. What should you tell her?
	You deserve it. Well done!
[Tersia]Tersia is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	I would've been doing something to save the universe.
[Tersia]The team is saying bad things about Tersia for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
	Do you really think that she would skip practice?
[Tersia]Tersia is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	I can feel the strength of that majestic creature.
[Tersia]Tersia seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to her. 
	Let's go look for her.
[Tersia]On a day off, Tersia is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
	I'd love to have a stable job first.
[Tersia]Tersia is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I just don't want to waste a single day in my life.)
[Tersia]There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?
	Let's split up and find the uniforms.

[Tersia]Tersia is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	They were a worthy opponent.
[Tersia]This was the worst game in your entire life...Tersia comes to you to cheer you up.

	I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
[Tersia]Tersia is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.
	Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
[Tersia]Tersia isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
	Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.
[Tersia]With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Tersia for solutions.
	I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
[Tersia]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.
[Tersia]You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Tersia and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest. 
	Let's give her some space.
[Tersia]Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
	This proves that even the aliens like Nari.
[Tersia]According to Tersia's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
	I thought they were just friends.
[Tersia]Tersia thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
	First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal. 
[Tersia]Tersia won a trip around the world from a radio event!
	Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.
[Tersia]Tersia suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.
	That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.
[Tersia]The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.
	Let's see what you have to say after the match.
[Tersia]You're sick and in bed when Tersia and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?
	I'm sorry...I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...
[Tersia]The match and the concert that Tersia was looking for start at the same time...
	I'm sorry that you couldn't go.
[Tersia]Tersia wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
	Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.
[Tersia]MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
	Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?
[Tersia]The match started and Tersia is standing still doing nothing.
	Looks like we'll have to do without her.

[Thor]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Thor asks how you feel. How should we answer?

	Hmm, wanna go shopping?
[Thor]It's a very intense match and Thor falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Thor up and the two exchange smiles.
	That player must have a heart of gold.
[Thor]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
[Thor]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Thor having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?
[Thor]Thor is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.
	Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.
[Thor]Thor scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!
	Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?

	It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.
[Thor]Thor falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?

	This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?
[Thor]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Thor. Let's talk to her.

[Thor]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Thor is curious and wants to take a look.
	They must love volunteer work!

	Hmm, there's a guy I'd like to beat up before I die.

	It's only a sport! The strongest team wins, and we are strong!

	It's surprising to see such advanced technology.
[Tiffany]Tiffany plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.

	All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.

[Tina]Tina's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Tina seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	I think that player likes you.

	I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
[Upiel]Upiel is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.
	Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
[Upiel]Upiel isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
	Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.
[Upiel]With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Upiel for solutions.
	I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
[Upiel]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.
[Upiel]You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Upiel and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest. 
	Let's give her some space.
[Upiel]Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
	This proves that even the aliens like Nari.
[Upiel]According to Upiel's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
	I thought they were just friends.
[Upiel]Upiel thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
	First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal. 
[Upiel]Upiel won a trip around the world from a radio event!
	Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.
[Upiel]Upiel suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.
	That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.
[Upiel]The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.
	Let's see what you have to say after the match.
[Upiel]You're sick and in bed when Upiel and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?
	I'm sorry...I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...
[Upiel]The match and the concert that Upiel was looking for start at the same time...
	I'm sorry that you couldn't go.
[Upiel]Upiel wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
	Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.
[Upiel]MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
	Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?
[Upiel]The match started and Upiel is standing still doing nothing.
	Looks like we'll have to do without her.

[Uriel]Uriel is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.
	We need a decent level of personal performance.
[Uriel]Uriel, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've never dreamt about soccer.
[Uriel]Uriel announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	I have faith in you.
[Uriel]Uriel is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
	That doesn't change what we must do.
[Uriel]Uriel wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
	Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
[Uriel]It seems that Uriel is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Uriel? Nah, she never gets lost.
[Uriel]You find Uriel lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[Uriel]Uriel says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
[Uriel]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[Uriel]Uriel wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
[Uriel]Uriel caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[Uriel]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Uriel some orders.
	Let's try out some forward passes.
[Uriel]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	It's time we use him as training material.
[Uriel]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Uriel seems to be worried.
	It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.
[Uriel]Uriel came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I hope that wasn't all you got.
[Uriel]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...We should get out of here.
[Uriel]Uriel is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
[Uriel]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Uriel seems to be sick of this.
	Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
[Uriel]Uriel looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	It's space. Anything can exist here.
[Uriel]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Uriel to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

[Uriel]Uriel seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.
	Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.
[Uriel]With a serious face, Uriel is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.
	Being together is enough for me.
[Uriel]Uriel came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.
[Uriel]Uriel is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.
	Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?
[Uriel]The team is having a good run and Uriel is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	Let's keep this momentum going!
[Uriel]Uriel seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	Let's open up a bright future with this ball.
[Uriel]Uriel seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.
	Don't be weak.
[Uriel]Uriel is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.
	Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.
[Uriel]Uriel is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.
[Uriel]Uriel plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.
[Uriel]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Uriel and talk about what to do.
	We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.
[Uriel]Uriel seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.
	I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great. 
[Uriel]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	...Uh...So no soccer?
[Uriel]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!
[Uriel]Uriel's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?
	Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.
[Uriel]During a match, Uriel bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?
	It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.
[Uriel]Uriel is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.
	It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.
[Uriel]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.
[Uriel]Uriel is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.
[Uriel]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Uriel is starting to get intimidated.
	Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.

[Ustiel]Ustiel is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.
	It's all thanks to you.
[Ustiel]After a meeting, Ustiel's eyes met yours a several times and Ustiel asks if she has something on her face.
	I was just thinking the team became stronger, thanks to you.
[Ustiel]With a serious look on her face, Ustiel warns you to go to the bathroom before the match.
	I'm surprised you said that. I won't ask what happened to you.
[Ustiel]Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Ustiel on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?
	You and I are already perfect. So I guess that means we shouldn't be saying our names.
[Ustiel]Ustiel is worried that she has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous things. What should we tell her?
	You're the most dangerous of them all.
[Ustiel]Ustiel is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to her.

	Nice play! Fantastic!
[Ustiel]Ustiel is having trouble focusing on the match. Let's help her out.
	Just calm down a bit. You got this.
[Ustiel]Ustiel is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.
	He's just material for leveling up.
[Ustiel]Ustiel doesn't like the new team advertisement video.
	It didn't portray your awesome performance.
[Ustiel]It's Ustiel's birthday. Let's give her a present.
	This is a championship trophy replica for you. The designs are inspired by you.
[Ustiel]You see Ustiel's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Ustiel. What should we do?
	She is probably not even listening...
[Ustiel]The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?
	It's time for some good food.
[Ustiel]You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also Ustiel's rival, has been severely injured and is in the hospital. What should you say to her?
	This won't be the end of your rival. 
[Ustiel]Ustiel comes to you and says that she has to leave the team because of personal reasons. What should we say?
	Well, I don't want to be the one holding you back. Good luck!
[Ustiel]Ustiel is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with Ustiel.
	I'll try to have the ball come your way.
[Ustiel]Ustiel is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.
	Pathetic...That is no king.
[Ustiel]You got a couple of tickets to Veronica's live concert. Ustiel seems to be interested.
	These are for you, of course. Here.
[Ustiel]Ustiel says she wants to cry because the goal keeper on the other team just won't go down no matter how many shots she makes.
	Let's come up with a new strategy to give you more synergy.

[Ustiel]Ustiel says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?
	I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.

	I guess I'll be chasing you on the road of glory.

[Ustiel]Ustiel looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?
	The space has prepared this beautiful stage for you.
[Ustiel]Ustiel says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.
	They're young but they have passion.
[Ustiel]Ustiel wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.
	Thankful beings that will be our +160.
[Ustiel]Ustiel is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.
	How about we make it to the top of the Galaxy League and shine the universe with the light within us?
[Ustiel]Ustiel says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	Tell them they should remember that they play for you.
[Ustiel]Ustiel says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.

	I don't think you need to worry about a diet.

	You both need to be disciplined by Ustiel.
[Ustiel]Ustiel is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	You seem like the princess...Scratch that, the queen.
[Ustiel]Ustiel went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	I feel sorry for the other team.
[Ustiel]Ustiel claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	I don't care what the case is.
[Ustiel]Ustiel seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	Be careful not to be stomped on...
[Ustiel]Ustiel says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	That's strange. I thought he was more of an authoritative character.
[Ustiel]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Ustiel hands you a present.
	(A chocker with a pretty radical design.)
[Ustiel]Ustiel says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.
	That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy, and love.

[Valentine]Valentine is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell him?
	Best of 4 should be our goal.
[Valentine]Valentine is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I think that being able to understand each other is the most important.
[Valentine]Valentine seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. He seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?
	It's within our grasp.

	The honor of our opponent is also important.
[Valentine]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give him some advice.
	Be true to yourself.

	I'm sure you're going to become an intergalactic fool.
[Valentine]Valentine is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to him.
	We must have faith in the Gate Keepers and win the Galaxy League.
[Valentine]Valentine is making a scene. He'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.
	Are you giving up before putting up a fight?
[Valentine]Valentine is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.
	This needs to be analyzed and fixed. Can you help me?
[Valentine]Valentine is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to him?
	No, it's not boring.
[Valentine]It's before the 2nd half, and Valentine is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.
	Don't give up until the end.
[Valentine]You forgot to lock Valentine and almost used him as training material! He looks very upset!
	It's my fault.
[Valentine]Valentine is confused that he won the MVP. What should you tell him?
	You deserve it. Well done!
[Valentine]Valentine is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.
	I would've been doing something to save the universe.
[Valentine]The team is saying bad things about Valentine for skipping practice. Time to intervene.
	Do you really think that he would skip practice?
[Valentine]Valentine is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Steel Canyon.
	I can feel the strength of that majestic creature.
[Valentine]Valentine seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to him.

	I'd love to have a stable job first.
[Valentine]Valentine is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I just don't want to waste a single day in my life.)
[Valentine]There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?
	Let's split up and find the uniforms.

	Valentine? Nah, he never gets lost.
[Valentine]You find Valentine lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[Valentine]Valentine says he doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. He thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.

	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.

	Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.

	Let's give her some space.
[Valkia]Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
	This proves that even the aliens like Nari.
[Valkia]According to Valkia's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
	I thought they were just friends.
[Valkia]Valkia thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?

[Valkia]Valkia is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.

[Valkia]Valkia is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	You can overcome this like always. Right?
[Valkia]Valkia seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	I'm starting to see true strength in this team.
[Valkia]You come across Valkia who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?

	That player is just messing with you.
[Valkia]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Valkia.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Valkia]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's give them a hand.
[Valkia]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Valkia and her opponent isn't over yet.
	You better win that fight!
[Valkia]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Valkia do?
	(Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)
[Valkia]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?

[Valkyrja Beth]Valkyrja Beth feels her heart races when she sees Littre.

	I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.
[Vermilion Bird]Vermilion Bird is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.
	Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?

[Virgil]Virgil is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.
	My teammates and their flawless play!
[Virgil]This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?
	I heard that the bath products on Earth are the best in the universe.
[Virgil]Virgil says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	That's bad. I'm sure it's something important!
[Virgil]The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.
	I can't stand this...I need to end this quickly and go take a shower.
[Virgil]Virgil seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	The eyepatch...I wonder if she washes it. She seems to have it on at all times.
[Virgil]Ogre's pony tail slapped Virgil in the face!
	Ugh...Gross...
[Virgil]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.
[Virgil]Virgil is suddenly showing massive improvement in his performance. He must've learned something during a match.
	You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.
[Virgil]Virgil says that the Swirlies are missing.
	I evolved them.
[Virgil]Virgil says he forgot to use his skill points before entering the match. What should we say to him?
	That's unacceptable!

	Ugh...I want to dig my eyes out.
[Virgil]Virgil picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Let's contact her and return this.
[Virgil]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	Well, now what?
[Virgil]Virgil is irritated because his opponent has the attribute advantage over him.
	Do I have to stop the match?
[Virgil]Virgil thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Hmm, her tail is a bit weird and her ears are definitely human...

	That doesn't change what we must do.

[Vitos]It seems that Vitos is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Vitos? Nah, he never gets lost.
[Vitos]You find Vitos lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[Vitos]Vitos says he doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. He thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.

	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[Vitos]Vitos wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
[Vitos]Vitos caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[Vitos]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Vitos some orders.
	Let's try out some forward passes.

	It's time we use him as training material.

	I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.

[Vitos]Vitos is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.
	Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.
[Vitos]Vitos is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.
[Vitos]Vitos plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.
	I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.
[Vitos]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Vitos and talk about what to do.
	We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.
[Vitos]Vitos seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.
	I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great. 
[Vitos]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	...Uh...So no soccer?
[Vitos]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!
[Vitos]Vitos's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next match. What should we say to him?
	Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.

[Vitos]Vitos is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to him.
	It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.

	Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.

	What, are you expecting something like ''I feel like I can fly'' or something?
[Vivid Fear]Vivid Fear suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?

	(Just nod your head.)
[Vivid Fear]Vivid Fear has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.
	You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.

	I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.

	How about just accepting the compliments for today?

	The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.
[Vivid Fear]Vivid Fear was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.
	It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!
[Vivid Fear]The team will not have a match for some time. Vivid Fear asks you about your plan.
	I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.
[Vivid Fear]It's a very intense match and Vivid Fear falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Vivid Fear up and the two exchange smiles.
	Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?
[Vivid Fear]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.
[Vivid Fear]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Vivid Fear having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	...I see two idiots standing in front of me...
[Vivid Fear]Vivid Fear is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.
	I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.

	That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!

	He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.

	If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.

	Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...

	(Ignore.)
[Vivid Fear]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Vivid Fear is curious and wants to take a look.
	We should probably ignore them and just walk by.
[Vivid Fear]Vivid Fear brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	Throw it away. NOW.

[Vivid Fear]You come across Vivid Fear, who was overwhelmed by her opponent throughout the game. Let's cheer her up.
	I'm proud that you played your game and didn't descend to the opponent's level.
[Vivid Fear]Vivid Fear is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.
	If you're better than your teammates, you should be the one to be considerate.

	Just playing soccer, that's all.

	Get yourselves together, guys. Are you going to give up already?

	It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.
[Vivid Fear]Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?
	Pathetic. We'll show them that we're better in many ways.
[Vivid Fear]The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?
	A square match is what suites a proud royalty.

	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[Vonchi]Vonchi says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[Vonchi]Vonchi says he forgot to use his skill points before entering the match. What should we say to him?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[Vonchi]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Vonchi]Vonchi picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.

[Vonchi]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Vonchi]Vonchi is irritated because his opponent has the attribute advantage over him.

	We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.
[Vonchi]It's a very intense match and Vonchi falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Vonchi up and the two exchange smiles.
	True sportsmanship! Wonderful!

[Wayne]You find Wayne lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?

[Wayne]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[Wayne]Wayne wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
[Wayne]Wayne caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[Wayne]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Wayne some orders.
	Let's try out some forward passes.
[Wayne]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	It's time we use him as training material.
[Wayne]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Wayne seems to be worried.
	It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.
[Wayne]Wayne came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I hope that wasn't all you got.
[Wayne]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.

	It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.

	Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
[Wayne]Wayne looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	It's space. Anything can exist here.
[Wayne]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Wayne to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

	We may have to go rough on the team and make them realize the problem.
[White Guardenia]With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to White Guardenia for solutions.
	We won't be able to win the league if we fail to overcome this. 
[White Guardenia]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	We're going to hunt that manager down and take back our money. We will show no mercy!

	This is a good chance to show the baby angels how rough soccer can be!
[White Guardenia]The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.
	Care to receive the ball with your face?
[White Guardenia]You're sick and in bed when White Guardenia and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?
	You guys...I'm about to cry...
[White Guardenia]The match and the concert that White Guardenia was looking for start at the same time...
	Channel that sorrow and rage towards your opponents and make them pay.
[White Guardenia]White Guardenia wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
	Maybe he just wants to duke it out.
[White Guardenia]MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
	Stop right there!
[White Guardenia]The match started and White Guardenia is standing still doing nothing.
	Run! Just start running!

[White Guardenia]White Guardenia seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.
	It's just a myth. Forget about it.

	There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.
[White Guardenia]White Guardenia seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.

	It's surprising to see such advanced technology.
[White Guardenia]White Guardenia plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	We'll see about it after the League.

	Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.

	I guess he's happy this is a good match.

	Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.

	If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.
[White Guardenia]White Guardenia is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.
[White Guardenia]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. White Guardenia is starting to get intimidated.
	This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.

[White Snow]White Snow is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	They were a worthy opponent.
[White Snow]This was the worst game in your entire life...White Snow comes to you to cheer you up.

[White Snow]The match and the concert that White Snow was looking for start at the same time...
	I'm sorry that you couldn't go.
[White Snow]White Snow wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
	Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.
[White Snow]MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.

	Looks like we'll have to do without her.

[White Snow]You find White Snow depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.
	Don't mind it. It's our fault. We weren't able to make use of your strength.

[White Snow]White Snow's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. White Snow seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	You're doing fine. Don't play your opponent's game.

	I think he felt better because of the positive energy you always have around you.
[White Snow]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.

[White Tiger]White Tiger is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...
	I have very specific standards for personality, looks, values, and background. Are you interested in hearing about it?

	I would like to hear what you think is the best team in the universe.
[White Tiger]White Tiger is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing any problems.
	That team is far from your style.
[White Tiger]Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some advice.
	Is winning really worth going that far?
[White Tiger]White Tiger is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.
	I..Respect your naming taste...
[White Tiger]White Tiger is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to her.

[White Tiger]White Tiger is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I want my dreams to come true.)

	What's done is done. Let's come up with a new design.

[White Tiger]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. White Tiger asks how you feel. How should we answer?

	Hmm, wanna go shopping?
[White Tiger]It's a very intense match and White Tiger falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps White Tiger up and the two exchange smiles.
	That player must have a heart of gold.
[White Tiger]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
[White Tiger]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across White Tiger having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?

[White Tiger]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. White Tiger is curious and wants to take a look.
	They must love volunteer work!
[White Tiger]White Tiger brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...

[William]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. William asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	What, are you expecting something like ''I feel like I'm in heaven'' or something?

	The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.

	It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!
[William]The team will not have a match for some time. William asks you about your plan.
	I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.
[William]It's a very intense match and William falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps William up and the two exchange smiles.
	Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?
[William]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.
[William]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across William having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?

	If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.

	Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...
[William]You come across Sammy while walking the street with William. Let's talk to her.
	(Ignore.)
[William]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. William is curious and wants to take a look.
	We should probably ignore them and just walk by.
[William]William brought a drink that he says he received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.

	I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.

	Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.

	I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.

	We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.
[William]William seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.
	I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great. 
[William]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	...Uh...So no soccer?
[William]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!

	I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.

[Wizol]Wizol is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to him.
	It's silly of you to worry about such things. Are you feeling okay?
[Wizol]Wizol is making a scene. He'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.
	The door's over there.
[Wizol]Wizol is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.
	It can't be perfect every time.
[Wizol]Wizol is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to him?
	How about we play baseball today?
[Wizol]It's before the 2nd half, and Wizol is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.
	There's nothing we can really do. Let's just get this over with.
[Wizol]You forgot to lock Wizol and almost used him as training material! He looks very upset!
	It's your fault.
[Wizol]Wizol is confused that he won the MVP. What should you tell him?

[Wizol]Wizol is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.

	I want one of those. It'll be fun to have a pet dragon.
[Wizol]Wizol seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to him. 
	It'll be alright. Don't worry.
[Wizol]On a day off, Wizol is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.
	If you find a beautiful woman, try talking to her!
[Wizol]Wizol is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?
	(I want every day to be exciting and fun.)
[Wizol]There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?
	It's finally time for some festival-soccer!

[Wizol]Wizol is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	I led our team to victory with wedgies!
[Wizol]This was the worst game in your entire life...Wizol comes to you to cheer you up.
	Please explain why you kicked the ball into our goal post, will you?
[Wizol]You're talking to Wizol about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow. Let's tell him your answer.
	If it's the end of the world, I'd pull of a crazy performance in a densely populated area before I go!

	Aren't you the one everybody should be afraid of?

	I hope you get scouted by an interesting team.
[Wizol]Wizol isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. He feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
	Let's invest some Crystals and get new players!
[Wizol]With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Wizol for solutions.
	How about we put that advanced technology of Metro City to use?
[Wizol]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	We could start a reset marathon.
[Wizol]You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Wizol and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest. 
	I could really use some grilled sweet potatoes and chestnuts.
[Wizol]Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
	I think she's something more than just an idol.
[Wizol]According to Wizol's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
	I want to see Tyler's true characteristics.
[Wizol]Wizol thinks he knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
	Of course we should tell Lynbell! What are you waiting for?
[Wizol]Wizol won a trip around the world from a radio event!
	...World? What about space? Isn't that more interesting?
[Wizol]Wizol suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.
	What's the agenda here? Are you trying to taint the pure angels?
[Wizol]The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.
	I didn't know I was a talented foot volleyball player!
[Wizol]You're sick and in bed when Wizol and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?
	Get closer so I can spread my germs!
[Wizol]The match and the concert that Wizol was looking for start at the same time...
	Let's hack the big screen so we can see the concert!
[Wizol]Wizol wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
	The character story left him a trauma.
[Wizol]MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
	...Maybe he just likes cats!
[Wizol]The match started and Wizol is standing still doing nothing.
	What is he doing? Is he a totem?

	We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.

	True sportsmanship! Wonderful!
[Wukong]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.

	You. I know you're doing much for the team without taking any credit.
[Wukong]Wukong is angry because he was criticized by his performance and is asking your opinion. Let's give him an answer.
	I want to practice with you, if that's okay with you. No?
[Wukong]Wukong, who has shown absolutely superb chemistry with you, is embarrassed and says he didn't do all of that because of you. What should we say?
	Yeah? Well, I did what I did for you.
[Wukong]Wukong wants to have an academic conversation about the 5th dimension, string theory, and other infamously hard space theories. Why...?
	(Maybe he brought snacks but is too shy to share it with me.)
[Wukong]Wukong looks disappointed about the size of the Galaxy League. What would be an appropriate response?

	Be honest and show a sincere attitude.

[Yuna]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Yuna.
	I think he felt better because of the positive energy you always have around you.
[Yuna]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.
[Yuna]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Yuna and her opponent isn't over yet.
	I've never seen her worked up that much.
[Yuna]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Yuna do?
	(Give her instructions so that she can do her share of the cleaning quickly.)
[Yuna]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	We didn't play dirty, right?
[Yuna]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Yuna. What should you say?
	I hope you two become good rivals.
[Yuna]Yuna is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Don't worry about me! Do your job!
[Yuna]Latios is chatting with Yuna after the match. Let's barge in.
	Yuna was fantastic on the field, right?

[Yuna]Yuna seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.
	They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.
[Yuna]With a serious face, Yuna is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.
	A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?
[Yuna]Yuna came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	Just please go with that boring strategy.
[Yuna]Yuna is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.
	They're on cooldown.
[Yuna]The team is having a good run and Yuna is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	As long as we're not used as training material...
[Yuna]Yuna seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)
[Yuna]Yuna seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.
	Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.
[Yuna]Yuna is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.
	Well, having a good ace skill is a start.
[Yuna]Yuna is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.
[Yuna]Yuna plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	I'm thinking of opening a shop.
[Yuna]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Yuna and talk about what to do.
	I hope they have a ''Continue'' button around here.
[Yuna]Yuna seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.
	Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!
[Yuna]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	Cool! Awesome!
[Yuna]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	Has he gone mad?
[Yuna]Yuna's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?
	Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.
[Yuna]During a match, Yuna bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?
	Wasn't that a glitch?
[Yuna]Yuna is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.
	I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.
[Yuna]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.
[Yuna]Yuna is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.
[Yuna]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Yuna is starting to get intimidated.
	He's obviously obsessed with soccer.

[Yuran]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Yuran asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	Wow. I'm sooooo happy.
[Yuran]Yuran suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.
[Yuran]Yuran is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.
	(Pat her on the head.)
[Yuran]Yuran has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.
	I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.
[Yuran]As Yuran said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.
	I'm sure it's going in a good direction.
[Yuran]The crowd is cheering for Yuran. Yuran seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.
	They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.
[Yuran]Yuran is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.
	I am so thankful to them.
[Yuran]Yuran was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.
	Oh, that'll be so cute!
[Yuran]The team will not have a match for some time. Yuran asks you about your plan.
	Hmm, wanna go shopping?
[Yuran]It's a very intense match and Yuran falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Yuran up and the two exchange smiles.
	That player must have a heart of gold.
[Yuran]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.
[Yuran]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Yuran having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?
[Yuran]Yuran is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.
	Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.
[Yuran]Yuran scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!
	Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?
[Yuran]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Yuran.
	It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.
[Yuran]Yuran falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?
	Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.
[Yuran]Yuran lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?
[Yuran]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Yuran. Let's talk to her.
	Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.
[Yuran]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Yuran is curious and wants to take a look.
	They must love volunteer work!
[Yuran]Yuran brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...

[Yuran]You find Yuran depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.
	It's not your fault that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!
[Yuran]Yuran is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.
	Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes. You're a precious part of this team.
[Yuran]You come across Yuran being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.
	Don't use that ability on the field...
[Yuran]Yuran is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.
	Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes, will you?
[Yuran]Yuran is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.
	I'll sleep by your side tonight.
[Yuran]Yuran is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.
[Yuran]Yuran seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	Perfect! No mistakes made!
[Yuran]You come across Yuran who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?
	I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.
[Yuran]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.
[Yuran]You're watching the storm with Yuran and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!
[Yuran]Yuran looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.
[Yuran]Yuran's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Yuran seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	I think that player likes you.
[Yuran]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Yuran.
	You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.
[Yuran]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!
[Yuran]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Yuran and her opponent isn't over yet.
	Hey! The match is over!
[Yuran]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Yuran do?
	(Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.)
[Yuran]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?

	Well, you're as cute as Yuran.
[Yuran]Yuran is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Don't come over here! It's dangerous!
[Yuran]Latios is chatting with Yuran after the match. Let's barge in.
	Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's our pretty girl.

[Yuri]Yuri says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?
	Of course! Everybody is counting on you!
[Yuri]Yuri asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give her a sincere answer.
	I want to see everybody smile. I think that'll make me happy.
[Yuri]Yuri is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.
	I'd like to keep one as a pet.
[Yuri]Yuri looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?
	Where do you think those comets are going?
[Yuri]Yuri says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.
	Yeah, I mean they could get hurt.
[Yuri]Yuri wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.
	I'm planning to make a whole line of merchandise with them as the character.
[Yuri]Yuri is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.
	Life is a light of its own.
[Yuri]Yuri says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	Just hear them out and smile. They'll feel better.
[Yuri]Yuri says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	I sense that there's something she hasn't told us yet...

	Congratulations! How did you guys get along?
[Yuri]Yuri is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?

[Yuri]Yuri is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	She seems like a nice girl.
[Yuri]Yuri went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	Yuri is in danger! We have to save her!
[Yuri]Yuri claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	She must've made a mistake.
[Yuri]Yuri seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	We can do this! Let's go!
[Yuri]Yuri says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	Yeah, they get along pretty well.
[Yuri]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Yuri hands you a present.
	(A cute and pretty pendant)
[Yuri]Yuri says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.
	I think she likes him.

[Yuri]You find Yuri depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.
	You did well and I thank you for that.
[Yuri]Yuri is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.
	That's why I need your help.
[Yuri]You come across Yuri being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.
	Are you feeling alright?
[Yuri]Yuri is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.
	I was always looking forward for that moment.
[Yuri]Yuri is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.
	It's just a dream. Forget about it.
[Yuri]Yuri is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	You can overcome this like always. Right?
[Yuri]Yuri seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	I'm starting to see true strength in this team.
[Yuri]You come across Yuri who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?
	Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.
[Yuri]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Can't you cook ramen by yourself?
[Yuri]You're watching the storm with Yuri and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	What's wrong with her?
[Yuri]Yuri looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Littre will be fine.
[Yuri]Yuri's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Yuri seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	That player is just messing with you.
[Yuri]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Yuri.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Yuri]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's give them a hand.
[Yuri]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Yuri and her opponent isn't over yet.
	You better win that fight!
[Yuri]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Yuri do?
	(Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)
[Yuri]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	They will never learn with an attitude like that.
[Yuri]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Yuri. What should you say?
	Well, Yuri does have that kind of charm.
[Yuri]Yuri is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Can you peel this guy off of me?
[Yuri]Latios is chatting with Yuri after the match. Let's barge in.
	I'm looking forward to our next match!

[Z001 Veronica]Veronica is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.
	It's all thanks to you.
[Z001 Veronica]After a meeting, Veronica's eyes met yours a several times and Veronica asks if she has something on her face.
	I was just thinking the team became stronger, thanks to you.
[Z001 Veronica]With a serious look on her face, Veronica warns you to go to the bathroom before the match.
	I'm surprised you said that. I won't ask what happened to you.
[Z001 Veronica]Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Veronica on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?
	You and I are already perfect. So I guess that means we shouldn't be saying our names.
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica is worried that she has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous things. What should we tell her?
	You're the most dangerous of them all.
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to her.
	Let's go tell the manager.
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica is asking if you have a special person who you would like to share happy moments with. Let's give her an answer.
	I think that may be you.
[Z001 Veronica]You find Veronica being very excited after performing an awesome play. How will you react?
	Nice play! Fantastic!
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica is having trouble focusing on the match. Let's help her out.
	Just calm down a bit. You got this.
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.
	He's just material for leveling up.
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica doesn't like the new team advertisement video.
	It didn't portray your awesome performance.
[Z001 Veronica]It's Veronica's birthday. Let's give her a present.
	This is a championship trophy replica for you. The designs are inspired by you.
[Z001 Veronica]You see Veronica's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Veronica. What should we do?
	She is probably not even listening...
[Z001 Veronica]The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?
	It's time for some good food.
[Z001 Veronica]You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also Veronica's rival, has been severely injured and is in the hospital. What should you say to her?
	This won't be the end of your rival. 
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica comes to you and says that she has to leave the team because of personal reasons. What should we say?
	Well, I don't want to be the one holding you back. Good luck!
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with Veronica.
	I'll try to have the ball come your way.
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.
	Pathetic...That is no king.
[Z001 Veronica]You got a couple of tickets to Veronica's live concert. Veronica seems to be interested.
	These are for you, of course. Here.
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica says she wants to cry because the goal keeper on the other team just won't go down no matter how many shots she makes.
	Let's come up with a new strategy to give you more synergy.

[Z001 Veronica]Veronica is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.
	Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?
	It's the place of dreams colliding.
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	Why don't you join them and find out?
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.
	Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.
	Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.
	My fans!
[Z001 Veronica]This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?
	Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	He'll remember someday.
[Z001 Veronica]The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.
	Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.
[Z001 Veronica]Ogre's pony tail slapped Veronica in the face!
	That must hurt.
[Z001 Veronica]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.
	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[Z001 Veronica]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[Z001 Veronica]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[Z001 Veronica]Veronica thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[Z044 Uria]The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Uria asks how you feel. How should we answer?
	What, are you expecting something like ''I feel like I can fly'' or something?
[Z044 Uria]Uria suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?
	How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.
[Z044 Uria]Uria is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.
	(Just nod your head.)
[Z044 Uria]Uria has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.
	You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.
[Z044 Uria]As Uria said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.
	I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.
[Z044 Uria]The crowd is cheering for Uria. Uria seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.
	How about just accepting the compliments for today?
[Z044 Uria]Uria is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.
	The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.
[Z044 Uria]Uria was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.
	It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!
[Z044 Uria]The team will not have a match for some time. Uria asks you about your plan.
	I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.
[Z044 Uria]It's a very intense match and Uria falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Uria up and the two exchange smiles.
	Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?
[Z044 Uria]The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.
	I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.
[Z044 Uria]You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Uria having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?
	...I see two idiots standing in front of me...
[Z044 Uria]Uria is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.
	I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.
[Z044 Uria]Uria scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!
	That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!
[Z044 Uria]A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Uria.
	He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.
[Z044 Uria]Uria falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?
	If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.
[Z044 Uria]Uria lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?
	Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...
[Z044 Uria]You come across Sammy while walking the street with Uria. Let's talk to her.
	(Ignore.)
[Z044 Uria]Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Uria is curious and wants to take a look.
	We should probably ignore them and just walk by.
[Z044 Uria]Uria brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.
	Throw it away. NOW.

[Z044 Uria]Uria is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.
	Wreck the other team.
[Z044 Uria]Uria, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	It was an intense feeling as if I was going against the strongest team in the universe.
[Z044 Uria]Uria announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	I feel bad for the players that have to face you.
[Z044 Uria]Uria is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
	Stop whining. I like it better when you're arrogant and sarcastic.
[Z044 Uria]Uria wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
	I'm surprised you care so much for your friends.
[Z044 Uria]It seems that Uria is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Let's ask Khirel to find her...
[Z044 Uria]You find Uria lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hmm, I guess you're more domestic than I thought.
[Z044 Uria]Uria says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	I think you two have something in common...
[Z044 Uria]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	Don't kill him, okay?
[Z044 Uria]Uria wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	Sure. Let's beat them all and take the prize money!
[Z044 Uria]Uria caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	I think we should hang him.
[Z044 Uria]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Uria some orders.
	Make him know who he's up against.
[Z044 Uria]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!
[Z044 Uria]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Uria seems to be worried.
	Weakling. Should've been rougher on that player.
[Z044 Uria]Uria came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I'm sure you got scammed.
[Z044 Uria]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	James and Bora...Who's the villain? 
[Z044 Uria]Uria is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	We'll find the ones that did this and use them as fertilizers.
[Z044 Uria]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Uria seems to be sick of this.
	Iron Claw!
[Z044 Uria]Uria looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.
[Z044 Uria]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Uria to set some simple rules.
	This team is a mess. Gather everybody on the field. I'll knock that spirit back into you guys if I have to.

[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.
	Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?
	It's the place of dreams colliding.
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	Why don't you join them and find out?
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.
	Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.
	Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.
	My fans!
[Z077 Cashlove]This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?
	Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	He'll remember someday.
[Z077 Cashlove]The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.
	Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.
[Z077 Cashlove]Ogre's pony tail slapped Cashlove in the face!
	That must hurt.
[Z077 Cashlove]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.
	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[Z077 Cashlove]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[Z077 Cashlove]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

[Z077 Cashlove]You find Cashlove depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.
	You did well and I thank you for that.
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.
	That's why I need your help.
[Z077 Cashlove]You come across Cashlove being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.
	Are you feeling alright?
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.
	I was always looking forward for that moment.
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.
	It's just a dream. Forget about it.
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?
	You can overcome this like always. Right?
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.
	I'm starting to see true strength in this team.
[Z077 Cashlove]You come across Cashlove who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?
	Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.
[Z077 Cashlove]You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.
	Can't you cook ramen by yourself?
[Z077 Cashlove]You're watching the storm with Cashlove and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.
	What's wrong with her?
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.
	Littre will be fine.
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Cashlove seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.
	That player is just messing with you.
[Z077 Cashlove]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Cashlove.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Z077 Cashlove]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
	Let's give them a hand.
[Z077 Cashlove]The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Cashlove and her opponent isn't over yet.
	You better win that fight!
[Z077 Cashlove]The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Cashlove do?
	(Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)
[Z077 Cashlove]The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?
	They will never learn with an attitude like that.
[Z077 Cashlove]A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Cashlove. What should you say?
	Well, Cashlove does have that kind of charm.
[Z077 Cashlove]Cashlove is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?
	Can you peel this guy off of me?
[Z077 Cashlove]Latios is chatting with Cashlove after the match. Let's barge in.
	I'm looking forward to our next match!

[Z088 Beta]Beta is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.
	We need a decent level of personal performance.
[Z088 Beta]Beta, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've never dreamt about soccer.
[Z088 Beta]Beta announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	I have faith in you.
[Z088 Beta]Beta is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
	That doesn't change what we must do.
[Z088 Beta]Beta wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
	Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
[Z088 Beta]It seems that Beta is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Beta? Nah, she never gets lost.
[Z088 Beta]You find Beta lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[Z088 Beta]Beta says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
[Z088 Beta]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[Z088 Beta]Beta wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
[Z088 Beta]Beta caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[Z088 Beta]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Beta some orders.
	Let's try out some forward passes.
[Z088 Beta]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	It's time we use him as training material.
[Z088 Beta]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Beta seems to be worried.
	It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.
[Z088 Beta]Beta came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I hope that wasn't all you got.
[Z088 Beta]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...We should get out of here.
[Z088 Beta]Beta is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
[Z088 Beta]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Beta seems to be sick of this.
	Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
[Z088 Beta]Beta looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	It's space. Anything can exist here.
[Z088 Beta]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Beta to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

[Z088 Beta]Beta is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	The other team went home crying!
[Z088 Beta]This was the worst game in your entire life...Beta comes to you to cheer you up.
	Thanks...I know you're the one that's the most devastated...Let's do better next time.
[Z088 Beta]You're talking to Beta about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow. Let's tell her your answer.
	Hmm, there's a guy I'd like to beat up before I die.
[Z088 Beta]Beta is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.
	It's only a sport! The strongest team wins, and we are strong!
[Z088 Beta]Beta is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.
	Make the scouters fall in love with your performance!
[Z088 Beta]Beta isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
	We may have to go rough on the team and make them realize the problem.
[Z088 Beta]With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Beta for solutions.
	We won't be able to win the league if we fail to overcome this. 
[Z088 Beta]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	We're going to hunt that manager down and take back our money. We will show no mercy!
[Z088 Beta]You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Beta and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest. 
	There's no time for tears! Find out who did this and bring justice!
[Z088 Beta]Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
	The stage is so majestic! It's awesome!
[Z088 Beta]According to Beta's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
	William doesn't know how to respect his seniors.
[Z088 Beta]Beta thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
	...Sometimes, the truth is better to be left a secret.
[Z088 Beta]Beta won a trip around the world from a radio event!
	What about soccer? You'll have to go through me to go on that trip!
[Z088 Beta]Beta suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.
	This is a good chance to show the baby angels how rough soccer can be!
[Z088 Beta]The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.
	Care to receive the ball with your face?
[Z088 Beta]You're sick and in bed when Beta and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?
	You guys...I'm about to cry...
[Z088 Beta]The match and the concert that Beta was looking for start at the same time...
	Channel that sorrow and rage towards your opponents and make them pay.
[Z088 Beta]Beta wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
	Maybe he just wants to duke it out.
[Z088 Beta]MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
	Stop right there!
[Z088 Beta]The match started and Beta is standing still doing nothing.
	Run! Just start running!

[Z088 Jackson]Jackson says he's the center of the team and asks if you agree with him. How should we answer?
	Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.
[Z088 Jackson]Jackson asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give him a sincere answer.
	I'm going to make a joke before I start crying!
[Z088 Jackson]Jackson is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.
	Do you think they'll be tasty?
[Z088 Jackson]Jackson looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to him?
	Do you think any of those comets are populated?
[Z088 Jackson]Jackson says he's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give him an answer.
	Teach them how adults play soccer.
[Z088 Jackson]Jackson wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give him an answer.
	Beginner level monsters in an RPG game.
[Z088 Jackson]Jackson is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to him.
	That's deep. I think it's cool.
[Z088 Jackson]Jackson says he was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.
	You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.
[Z088 Jackson]Jackson says that Bell seemed depressed when he told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.
	It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry.
[Z088 Jackson]Jackson seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell him?
	Don't forget that we exist! Haha!
[Z088 Jackson]Jackson is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?
	Please don't forget about the match.
[Z088 Jackson]Jackson says he's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.
	Is her name really Kiki?
[Z088 Jackson]Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Jackson seems to be troubled. What should we do?
	If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?
[Z088 Jackson]Jackson is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle. 
	It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.
[Z088 Jackson]Jackson went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?
	We should think about how to make fun of him when he comes back.
[Z088 Jackson]Jackson claims he saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?
	Maybe Sophie is actually a male...?
[Z088 Jackson]Jackson seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.
	Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?
[Z088 Jackson]Jackson says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.
	Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.
[Z088 Jackson]You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Jackson hands you a present.
	(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)
[Z088 Jackson]Jackson says that he thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give him an answer.
	Maybe she's up to something.

[Z088 Jackson]Jackson is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give him an answer.
	We need a decent level of personal performance.

[Z088 Zach]Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Zach is asking how he did in the match.
	You bring the best out of the team. Good work!
[Z088 Zach]Zach looks excited as he's talking with the team about pets. He turns around and asks you what kind of pet you like.
	I think that a baby duck following its mother is one of the most adorable things to watch.
[Z088 Zach]You come across Zach thinking about the value of soccer. What should we tell him?
	The field is a ground of hopes and dreams. Isn't that enough?
[Z088 Zach]Zach is having trouble focusing on the match because of the affectionate emotion he feels. He says he must leave now to propose to his lover. What should we say?
	Think about your teammates that are counting on you.
[Z088 Zach]Zach blushes up and tells you that he's happy he can play soccer with you. What should we tell him?
	Me too. You're a good leader.
[Z088 Zach]Zach is asking for special training sessions because he's not satisfied with today's performance. What should we tell him?
	If that's your wish.
[Z088 Zach]Zach did his best, but he failed to achieve the results he wanted and looks sad. We should say something to him.
	It's experiences like this that bonds us together.
[Z088 Zach]Zach is asking you about what you like besides soccer.
	I like board games about war. I admire famous commanders.
[Z088 Zach]Zach feels his heart races when he sees Littre.
	...Do you want a Superb Power-up?
[Z088 Zach]Kuma is caught sneaking in the woman's locker room once again. We should talk with Zach about what to do with him.
	I'm not sure if it's safe, but we can use him for leveling up.
[Z088 Zach]Zach continues to charge into the opponent's defense line and keeps failing. What should we do?
	(Make a strategic decision.)
[Z088 Zach]Zach is being annoying with his offensive words. What should we do?
	(Kick him out of the team if things can't be handled.)
[Z088 Zach]It's dinner time and Zach is staring at his carrot soup with a troubled look. What should we do?
	(Tell him that carrots are good for the body and to eat it all.)
[Z088 Zach]It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking up for the morning training. What should we tell Zach to do?
	They all need scolding.
[Z088 Zach]Zach says that the soup tastes funny. What should we do?
	Let's stay away from the soup, just in case.
[Z088 Zach]Zach is furious about the referee that's clearly favoring the other team. Should we stop him?
	Ignore the referee. Focus on the match.
[Z088 Zach]It suddenly began to rain heavily. You see Zach running up ahead.
	(Catch up and share your umbrella.)
[Z088 Zach]You witnessed a player on the other side putting a tack in Zach's shoe.
	(Remove the tack and tell the manager on the other team.)
[Z088 Zach]During the team meeting, you find a player sleeping. What should you do?
	(Wake the player up and continue with the meeting.)
[Z088 Zach]Zach hurt his leg during the 1st half of the match, but he insists on playing. What should we tell him?
	Don't push yourself too hard. There are a lot of matches left.

[Z088 Zach]Zach seems to be lost after having a good match while his fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to him.
	It's just a myth. Forget about it.
[Z088 Zach]With a serious face, Zach is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give him an answer.
	Well, I'm sure we'll get an answer when we get to the end of this.
[Z088 Zach]Zach came to you after the match, and says he's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	Let's work up a solution.
[Z088 Zach]Zach is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.
	They support us from the shadows.
[Z088 Zach]The team is having a good run and Zach is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.
[Z088 Zach]Zach seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.
[Z088 Zach]Zach seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.
	Maybe if you increase your Strength...
[Z088 Zach]Zach is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.
	Flawless skills.
[Z088 Zach]Zach is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	It's surprising to see such advanced technology.
[Z088 Zach]Zach plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.
	We'll see about it after the League.
[Z088 Zach]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Zach and talk about what to do.
	Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.
[Z088 Zach]Zach seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.
	I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.
[Z088 Zach]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!
[Z088 Zach]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	I guess he's happy this is a good match.
[Z088 Zach]Zach's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next match. What should we say to him?
	If you keep it up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.
[Z088 Zach]During a match, Zach bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?
	We have to keep on going.
[Z088 Zach]Zach is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to him.
	Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.
[Z088 Zach]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.
[Z088 Zach]Zach is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.
[Z088 Zach]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Zach is starting to get intimidated.
	This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.

[Z101 Raklet]Raklet is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	They were a worthy opponent.
[Z101 Raklet]This was the worst game in your entire life...Raklet comes to you to cheer you up.
	Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.
[Z101 Raklet]You're talking to Raklet about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow. Let's tell her your answer.
	I would say goodbye to all my friends.
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.
	I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.
	Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
	Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.
[Z101 Raklet]With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Raklet for solutions.
	I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
[Z101 Raklet]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.
[Z101 Raklet]You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Raklet and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest. 
	Let's give her some space.
[Z101 Raklet]Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
	This proves that even the aliens like Nari.
[Z101 Raklet]According to Raklet's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
	I thought they were just friends.
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
	First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal. 
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet won a trip around the world from a radio event!
	Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.
	That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.
[Z101 Raklet]The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.
	Let's see what you have to say after the match.
[Z101 Raklet]You're sick and in bed when Raklet and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?
	I'm sorry...I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...
[Z101 Raklet]The match and the concert that Raklet was looking for start at the same time...
	I'm sorry that you couldn't go.
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
	Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.
[Z101 Raklet]MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
	Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?
[Z101 Raklet]The match started and Raklet is standing still doing nothing.
	Looks like we'll have to do without her.

[Z101 Raklet]Raklet asks what you think is the most important ability in soccer. Give her an answer.
	Fair spirit and sportsmanship.
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet is criticizing the male teammates that were mesmerized by Lilith during the match. It's your job to defend your teammates.
	As pathetic as they are, let's let this one slide.
[Z101 Raklet]Being too excited, Raklet is overreacting while talking about the game. It seems she wants people to agree with her.
	I've never seen you so excited! You did a great job out there!
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet is asking what it would be like to date an alien. Give her your opinion.
	I guess the platonic side would be important.
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet seems to be planning to enter for the Galaxy League Mascot Contest. Let's talk to her.
	I think it'll suit you well.
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet asks what your plans are for the holidays when there's no training or match. Give her an answer.
	(Spy on the teammates to see if they're doing anything funny.)
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet heard stories about the world of the demons and asks what you think it'll be like.
	Whatever you do, just pray not to confront team Nightmare.
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet, who seems to be interested in Eve, is asking your opinion about her. What should we tell her?
	Maybe you could become a couple if you really really like her.
[Z101 Raklet]Recently, Raklet seems to enjoy chatting with Jin. She thinks Jin is funny. Let's talk with her.
	I can't believe he's still an active player even at that age.
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet is thinking about how to resist the psychological and mental attacks that the demons enjoy using. Let's give her advice.
	If they choose to attack you...Be careful.
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet is worried about Vermilion Bird. She thinks something is troubling Vermilion Bird.
	Maybe being the heir of an honorable family has its burdens.
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet's uniform is all messed up because of the filthy plays of her opponent. What should we do?
	(Give her a new uniform.)
[Z101 Raklet]A defender on the other team seems to have fallen in love with Raklet and is chasing her around the field. It looks like the player forgot about the match. What should we do?
	Come to me! I'll take care of it!
[Z101 Raklet]Kaidormu of the United Explorers is praising Raklet's plays. Let's add in.
	You just got praised by Kaidormu! That's awesome!
[Z101 Raklet]The team became furious after seeing Raklet fall by the focused attack of the opposing team and used that fury to win the game. Let's say something.
	You did well. Don't worry!
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet is having trouble finding a Spirit Stone that fits her needs and taste. Let's give her advice.
	I recommend the pure Paradise of Light.
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet is asking about the whereabouts of a teammate that hasn't seen for quite a while. Let's give her an answer.
	I sold him. We were in need of Gold.
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet is planning to go on a blind date with a close teammate. Should we say something to her?
	Just stay out of trouble.
[Z101 Raklet]It seems that Raklet is wondering what to do after a teammate proposed to her. It doesn't seem that she's not entirely uninterested. What should we do?
	Why don't you start with trading diaries?
[Z101 Raklet]Raklet is teasing her opponent that is having a hard time chasing her. What should we do?
	Stop goofing around and play the game.

[Z211 Litz]Litz is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.
	We need a decent level of personal performance.
[Z211 Litz]Litz, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.
	I've never dreamt about soccer.
[Z211 Litz]Litz announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.
	I have faith in you.
[Z211 Litz]Litz is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?
	That doesn't change what we must do.
[Z211 Litz]Litz wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.
	Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.
[Z211 Litz]It seems that Litz is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?
	Litz? Nah, she never gets lost.
[Z211 Litz]You find Litz lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?
	Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?
[Z211 Litz]Litz says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.
	Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.
[Z211 Litz]A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?
	We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.
[Z211 Litz]Litz wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?
	That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.
[Z211 Litz]Litz caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?
	Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.
[Z211 Litz]The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Litz some orders.
	Let's try out some forward passes.
[Z211 Litz]Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.
	It's time we use him as training material.
[Z211 Litz]You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Litz seems to be worried.
	It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.
[Z211 Litz]Litz came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.
	I hope that wasn't all you got.
[Z211 Litz]James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.
	...We should get out of here.
[Z211 Litz]Litz is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?
	It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.
[Z211 Litz]Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Litz seems to be sick of this.
	Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)
[Z211 Litz]Litz looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.
	It's space. Anything can exist here.
[Z211 Litz]The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Litz to set some simple rules.
	Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.

[Z211 Litz]Litz seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.
	It's just a myth. Forget about it.
[Z211 Litz]With a serious face, Litz is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.
	Well, I'm sure we'll get an answer when we get to the end of this.
[Z211 Litz]Litz came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?
	Let's work up a solution.
[Z211 Litz]Litz is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.
	They support us from the shadows.
[Z211 Litz]The team is having a good run and Litz is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.
[Z211 Litz]Litz seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.
	The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.
[Z211 Litz]Litz seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.
	Maybe if you increase your Strength...
[Z211 Litz]Litz is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.
	Flawless skills.
[Z211 Litz]Litz is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.
	It's surprising to see such advanced technology.
[Z211 Litz]Litz plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.
	We'll see about it after the League.
[Z211 Litz]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Litz and talk about what to do.
	Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.
[Z211 Litz]Litz seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.
	I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.
[Z211 Litz]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!
[Z211 Litz]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	I guess he's happy this is a good match.
[Z211 Litz]Litz's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?
	If you keep it up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.
[Z211 Litz]During a match, Litz bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?
	We have to keep on going.
[Z211 Litz]Litz is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.
	Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.
[Z211 Litz]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.
[Z211 Litz]Litz is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.
[Z211 Litz]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Litz is starting to get intimidated.
	This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.

[Z225 Ramia]Ramia is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	I led our team to victory with wedgies!
[Z225 Ramia]This was the worst game in your entire life...Ramia comes to you to cheer you up.
	Please explain why you kicked the ball into our goal post, will you?
[Z225 Ramia]You're talking to Ramia about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow. Let's tell her your answer.
	If it's the end of the world, I'd pull of a crazy performance in a densely populated area before I go!
[Z225 Ramia]Ramia is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.
	Aren't you the one everybody should be afraid of?
[Z225 Ramia]Ramia is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.
	I hope you get scouted by an interesting team.
[Z225 Ramia]Ramia isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
	Let's invest some Crystals and get new players!
[Z225 Ramia]With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Ramia for solutions.
	How about we put that advanced technology of Metro City to use?
[Z225 Ramia]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	We could start a reset marathon.
[Z225 Ramia]You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Ramia and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest. 
	I could really use some grilled sweet potatoes and chestnuts.
[Z225 Ramia]Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.
	I think she's something more than just an idol.
[Z225 Ramia]According to Ramia's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.
	I want to see Tyler's true characteristics.
[Z225 Ramia]Ramia thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?
	Of course we should tell Lynbell! What are you waiting for?
[Z225 Ramia]Ramia won a trip around the world from a radio event!
	...World? What about space? Isn't that more interesting?
[Z225 Ramia]Ramia suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.
	What's the agenda here? Are you trying to taint the pure angels?
[Z225 Ramia]The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.
	I didn't know I was a talented foot volleyball player!
[Z225 Ramia]You're sick and in bed when Ramia and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?
	Get closer so I can spread my germs!
[Z225 Ramia]The match and the concert that Ramia was looking for start at the same time...
	Let's hack the big screen so we can see the concert!
[Z225 Ramia]Ramia wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.
	The character story left him a trauma.
[Z225 Ramia]MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.
	...Maybe he just likes cats!
[Z225 Ramia]The match started and Ramia is standing still doing nothing.
	What is she doing? Is she a totem?

[Z225 Ramia]Ramia is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.

[ZE60 Alicia]Alicia is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.
	Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.
[ZE60 Alicia]Alicia is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?
	It's the place of dreams colliding.
[ZE60 Alicia]Alicia wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?
	Why don't you join them and find out?
[ZE60 Alicia]Alicia is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.
	Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!
[ZE60 Alicia]Alicia is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.
	Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!
[ZE60 Alicia]Alicia is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.
	My fans!
[ZE60 Alicia]This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?

[ZE60 Alicia]Alicia says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.
	He'll remember someday.

[ZE60 Alicia]Alicia seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?
	I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.
[ZE60 Alicia]Ogre's pony tail slapped Alicia in the face!

[ZE60 Alicia]It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?
	Wow, congratulations! (Claps)
[ZE60 Alicia]Alicia is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.
	Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!
[ZE60 Alicia]Alicia says that the Swirlies are missing.
	They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.
[ZE60 Alicia]Alicia says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?
	Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.
[ZE60 Alicia]You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.
	...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...
[ZE60 Alicia]Alicia picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.
	Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...
[ZE60 Alicia]Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.
	A crow?!
[ZE60 Alicia]Alicia is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.
	It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.
[ZE60 Alicia]Alicia thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.
	Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?

	True sportsmanship! Wonderful!

	Let's work up a solution.
[ZXXV Edward]Edward is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.
	They support us from the shadows.
[ZXXV Edward]The team is having a good run and Edward is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.
	There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.
[ZXXV Edward]Edward seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.

	Maybe if you increase your Strength...
[ZXXV Edward]Edward is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.

	It's surprising to see such advanced technology.
[ZXXV Edward]Edward plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.
	We'll see about it after the League.
[ZXXV Edward]It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Edward and talk about what to do.
	Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.
[ZXXV Edward]Edward seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.
	I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.
[ZXXV Edward]You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!
	Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!
[ZXXV Edward]Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?
	I guess he's happy this is a good match.
[ZXXV Edward]Edward's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next match. What should we say to him?
	If you keep it up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.
[ZXXV Edward]During a match, Edward bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?
	We have to keep on going.
[ZXXV Edward]Edward is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to him.
	Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.
[ZXXV Edward]You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.
	If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.
[ZXXV Edward]Edward is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?
	All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.
[ZXXV Edward]Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Edward is starting to get intimidated.
	This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.

[Zhen Long]Zhen Long is looking excited and asks how the match went.
	They were a worthy opponent.
[Zhen Long]This was the worst game in your entire life...Zhen Long comes to you to cheer you up.

	I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.
[Zhen Long]Zhen Long is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give him some advice.
	Let's make that our goal and make it happen.
[Zhen Long]Zhen Long isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. He feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.
	Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.
[Zhen Long]With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Zhen Long for solutions.
	I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.
[Zhen Long]The team manager ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?
	Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.
[Zhen Long]You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Zhen Long and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.

	Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.
[Zhen Long]Zhen Long suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.
	That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.
[Zhen Long]The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.

[Zhen Long]You're sick and in bed when Zhen Long and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?

[Zhen Long]The match and the concert that Zhen Long was looking for start at the same time...

	Littre will be fine.
[Zhen Long]Zhen Long's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Zhen Long seems to be nervous. Let's talk to him.

[Zhen Long]Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Zhen Long.
	Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?
[Zhen Long]The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.
