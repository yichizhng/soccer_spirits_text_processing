Angela	
You come across Angela who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?	
I think i'll get injured too if you're on the field.Please sit on the bench	
Trust me and your teammates.Sit this one out.	-1
Don't push yourself too hard.Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.	3
Angela	
The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Angela and her opponent isn't over yet.	
You better win that fight!	3
Hey! The match is over!	
I've never seen her worked up that much.	
Angela	
The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?	
Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.	-1
We didn't play dirty, right?	1
They will never learn with an attitude like that.	3
Angela	
You're watching the storm with Angela and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.	
Is something troubling her? I'm having a bad feeling.	
What's wrong with her?	3
She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!	
Angela	
Angela is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.	
Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes. You're a precious part of this team.	
Don't be anxious. Have faith and keep following me.	
That's why I need your help.	3
Angela	
Angela seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.	-1
I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great.	1
Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!	3
Angela	
A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Angela. What should you say?	
Well, Angela does have that kind of charm.	3
Well, you're as cute as Angela.	1
I hope you two become good rivals.	-1
Angela	
It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Angela and talk about what to do.	
We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.	-1
I hope they have a "Continue" button around here.	3
Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.	
Angela	
The team is having a good run and Angela is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.	
Let's keep this momentum going!	1
As long as we're not used as training material...	3
There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.	-1
Angela	
The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Angela do?	
Give her instructions so that she can do her share of the cleaning quickly.	-1
Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.	3
Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.	
Angela	
During a match, Angela bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	3
We have to keep on going.	
It's something happened during the match. Don"t be so hard on yourself.	
Angela	
Latios is chatting with Angela after the match. Let's barge in.	
Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's our pretty girl.	-1
Angela was fantastic on the field, right?	1
I'm looking forward to our next match!	3
Angela	
Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Angela.	
I think he felt better of the positive energy you always have around you.	1
Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?	3
You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on you own foot.	-1
Angela	
Angela seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.	
They say the fortune telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.	3
It's just a myth. Forget about it.	-1
Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.	-1
Angela	
Angela came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	
Let's work up a solution.	1
I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.	1
Just please go with that boring strategy.	3
Angela	
Angela is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	-1
I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.	3
Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.	
Angela	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Angela is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.	-1
He's obviously obsessed with soccer.	3
This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their backline. 	1
Angela	
With a serious face, Angela is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.	
Being together is enough for me	-1
Away that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?	3
Well, I'm sure we'll get an answer when we get to the end of this.	-1
Angela	
Angela is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.	
It's surprising to see such advanced technology.	
Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.	
Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.	3
Angela	
Angela is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?	
I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.	3
All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.	1
I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.	-1
Angela	
Angela's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?	
If you keep it up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.	
Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.	
Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.	3
Angela	
Angela is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?	
You can overcome this like always. Right?	3
It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.	
Let's solve the problems one by one.	1
Angela	
Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?	
The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!	1
Has he gone mad?	3
I guess he's happy this is a good match.	
Angela	
Angela is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?	
Don't worry about me! Do your job!	1
Can you peel this guy off of me?	3
Don't come over here! It's dangerous!	-1
Angela	
Angela is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.	
They're on cooldown.	3
They support us from the shadows.	
Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one.  Right?	-1
Angela	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	-1
Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.	1
Let's give them a hand.	3
Angela	
Angela is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.	
I'm afraid to be honest.	-1
I was always looking forward for that moment.	3
Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes, will you?	1
Angela	
Angela is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.	
Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.	
Well, having a good ace skill is a start.	3
Flawless skills.	
Angela	
Angela seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.	
Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.	3
Maybe if you increase your Strength...	
Don't be weak.	1
Angela	
Angela seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.	
The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.	-1
Let's open up a bright future with this ball.	1
Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)	3
Angela	
Angela's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Angela seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.	
That player is just messing with you.	3
I think that player likes you.	
You're doing fine. Don't play your opponent's game.	1
Angela	
Angela looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.	
Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.	
Don't worry. Leave it up to me.	-1
Littre will be fine.	3
Angela	
You find Angela depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.	
Don't mind it. It's our fault. We weren't able to make use of your strength.	
You did well and I thank you for that.	3
It's not your fualt that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!	
Angela	
You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.	
If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.	
I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.	-1
Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.	3
Angela	
You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!	
Cool! Awesome!	3
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	
...Uh...So no soccer?	
Angela	
Angela plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.	
I'm thinking of opening a shop.	3
We'll see about it after the league.	
I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.	-1
Angela	
Angela seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.	
It's thanks to you! Thanks for listening to my instructions.	1
I'm starting to see the true strengh in this team.	3
Perfect! No mistakes made!	-1
Angela	
Angela is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.	
I'll sleep by your side tonight.	-1
I see. We must be careful. I'll be watching over you.	-1
It's just a dream. Forget about it.	3
Angela	
You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.	
Can't you cook ramen by yourself?	3
Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.	-1
Is Marilyn your mother or nanny?	
Angela	
You come across Angela being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.	
Are you feeling alright?	3
Don't use that ability on the field.	
Don't worry, I'll go with you.	
	
Death Queen	
Death Queen has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.	
You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.	
Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it. You should keep that going.	3
I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.	
Death Queen	
Death Queen wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?	
Perfect planning and perfect execution	
All goes as planned....Hmm? Just ignore that.	
Why don't you join them and find out?	3
Death Queen	
Ogre's pony tail slapped Death Queen in the face!	
Even his hair is a weapon! Is that even allowed?	
That must hurt.	
Ugh...Gross...	1
Death Queen	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	3
Death Queen	
Death Queen lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?	
Well, this could have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you... 	
I will avenge you!	3
Death Queen	
Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Death Queen is curious and wants to take a look.	
We should probably ignore them and just walk by.	
Let's go help them!	3
They must love volunteer work!	
Death Queen	
Death Queen is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.	
I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.	
The fans love your performance!	3
Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.	
Death Queen	
Death Queen scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!	
Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?	
That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!	
You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!	3
Death Queen	
Death Queen is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.	
My teammates and their flawless play!	
My friends from previous life... They would be pleased to see me win.	
My fans!	3
Death Queen	
Death Queen says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.	
Hmm, a revived person that forgot his purpose...Reminds me of somebody.	
He'll remember someday.	3
That's bad. I'm sure it's something important!	
Death Queen	
Death Queen brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...	
Throw it away. NOW.	
Drink it up!	3
Death Queen	
Death Queen says that the Swirlies are missing.	
They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.	
They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.	3
I evolved them.	
Death Queen	
Death Queen seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?	
I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.	3
The eye patch...I wonder if she washes it. She seems to have it on all times.	
That's dangerous secret you're trying to find out about. Do you still want to know?	
Death Queen	
A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Death Queen.	
I feel like he's mocking us!	3
It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.	
He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.	1
Death Queen	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Death Queen asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel like i can fly" or something?	
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	3
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	1
Death Queen	
The crowd is cheering for Death Queen. Death Queen seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.	
They're all in love with your enthusiastic plays.	3
They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.	
How about just acceping the compliments for today?	
Death Queen	
Death Queen is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.	
Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.	3
It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy! This is nonsense!	
We haven't awakened our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyond!	-1
Death Queen	
Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.	
Well, now what?	
Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?	
A crow?!	3
Death Queen	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Death Queen having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match.	
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?	
...I see two idiots standing in front of me...	-1
Death Queen	
Death Queen suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about a salad? I'm on a diet.	
How could you think about eating in a time like this? I'm dissapointed in you.	
Good idea. Let's go get some meat!	3
Death Queen	
Death Queen is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.	
(Put your thumbs up, ink, and send a juicy smile.)	3
(Pat her on the head.)	
(Just nod your head.)	
Death Queen	
As Death Queen said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	1
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	3
Death Queen	
Death Queen is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.	
This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!	1
Gate Keeper dolls!Why not!	
How about some presents for your parents?	1
Death Queen	
Death Queen falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?	 
If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.	
Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!	3
Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.	1
Death Queen	
Death Queen is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?	
It's the place where the chosen ones learn about their destiny.	-1
It's the place of dreams colliding.	
It's stressful because we can't prepare for extraterrestrial sanitation. We're completely exposed to all those unknown...things	
Death Queen	
You come across Sammy while walking the street with Death Queen. Let's talk to her.	
We'll win next time!	3
Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.	
(Ignore.)	
Death Queen	
You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.	
...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...	3
Ugh...I want to dig my eyes out.	
Fontus...You sure are my archnemesis!	
Death Queen	
It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?	
I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.	
I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.	-1
Wow, congratulations! (Claps)	3
Death Queen	
Death Queen is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.	
Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!	3
You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.	
I knew this day would come.	
Death Queen	
It's a very intense match and Death Queen falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Death Queen up and the two exchange smiles.	
Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?	
True sportsmanship! Wonderful!	3
That player must have a heart of gold.	
Death Queen	
The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.	
I can't stand this...I need to end this quickly and go take a shower.	
What a depressing weather...	
Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!	3
	
Elise	
Elise seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.	
Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.	3
Maybe if you increase your Strength...	
Don't be weak.	
	
Jiho	
Jiho is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?	
That doesn't change what we must do.	3
Come on, cheer up. You're not being yourself.	
Stop whining. I like it better when you're arrogant and sarcastic.	
Jiho	
Jiho is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.	
He's just material for leveling up.	
I like how all of the Gate Keepers have different characteristics.	3
That bear...Is a hero...!	
Jiho	
Jiho came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.	
What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?	-1
I'm sure you got scammed.	-1
I hope that wasn't all you got.	
Jiho	
It seems that Jiho is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?	
Listen carefully and you'll find her.	-1
Let's ask Khirel to find her...	
Jiho? Nah, she never get lost.	3
Jiho	
Jiho is worried that she has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous things. What should we tell her?	
Look at the beautiful players! This is paradise!	1
You're the most dangerous of them all.	-1
Makes it worth the challenge, don't you think so?	3
Jiho	
Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Jiho on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?	
You and I are already perfect. So I guess that means we wouldn't be saying our names.	
I can't pick just one...	3
I think it should be you, but will you be able to return to your normal life after all of this...Wait, I'm going off topic, right?	
Jiho	
Jiho is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to her.	
I want you to form a team and catch every single bear near this locker room.	3
...If you want to say something,it's alright. I'll be listening.	
Let's go tell the manager. 	
Jiho	
James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.	
...We should get out of here.	
...It's about to go down...! Where's the popcorn?	-1
James and Bora...Who's the villain?	
Jiho	
Jiho says she wants to cry because the goal keeper on the other team just won't go down no matter how many shots she makes.	
Let's start by picking their defenses apart.	1
Let's come up with a new strategy to giove you more synergy.	1
I'll come up with a formation that can bring the best out of everybody.	
Jiho	
Jiho is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with Jiho.	
I think we should come up with an action speed deck or go for counterattacks...	1
I'll try to have the ball come your way.	
We can overcome this with team effort.	3
Jiho	
The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?	
Manga, anime, and figures...! Here I come!	
It's time for some good food.	
I guess I can go to the soccer gear shop.	3
Jiho	
Jiho looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.	
It's space. Anything can exist here.	3
How about we ask Jeunese?	
Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.	-1
Jiho	
Jiho, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.	
It was an intense feeling as if I was going against the strongest team in the universe.	1
I've never dreamt about soccer.	3
I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.	
Jiho	
You find Jiho lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?	
Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?	3
Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!	
Hmm, I guess you're more domestic than I thought.	
Jiho	
Jiho announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.	
You'll have to compete with me!	
I feel bad for the players that have to face you.	
I have faith in you.	3
Jiho	
Jiho is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.	
I'm sure there were mutliple reasons on why the kingdom fell. It's sad to hear such stories.	3
So, is that king entering Galaxy League?	
Pathetic..That is no king.	
Jiho	
Jiho wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?	
That seems like a dangerous idea... Let's not make any quick decisions.	3
What about just watching?	
Sure. Let's beat them all and take the prize money!	
Jiho	
Jiho is having trouble focusing on the match. Let's help her out.	
I'll teach you how to meditate to synchronize the breathing with other teammates.	3
It's impossible to focus on a field with so many handsome men.	
Just calm down a bit. You got this.	1
Jiho	
Jiho is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?	
We'll find the ones that did this and use them as fertilizers.	
It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.	3
Jiho	
Jiho	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	3
Stop right there, pig!	
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	-1
Jiho	
Jiho wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.	
I'm surprised you care so much for your friends.	-1
Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.	
It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.	-1
Jiho	
A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?	
I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!	
Don't kill him, okay?	
We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.	3
Jiho	
It's Jiho's birthday. Let's give her a present.	
Here! I made some cookies with the team.	3
I stole this treasure box from Kuma.	
This is a championship trophy replica for you. The designs are inspired by you.	
Jiho	
You see Jiho's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Jiho. What should we do?	
She is probably not even listening.	-1
Let's see how long they last. Come on guys!	3
Tell me if you like her. Just say the words and i'll scout her.	
Jiho	
Jiho doesn't like the new team advertisement video.	
There's not enough fan service.	-1
It didn't portray your awesome performance.	
It didn't have to have the bench warmers in the video.	3
Jiho	
You find Jiho being very excited after performing an awesome play. How will you react?	
Can't you do that more often?! (Cries)	
Nice play! Fantastic!	1
Now we're starting to look like a team!	3
Jiho	
Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Jiho seems to be sick of this.	
Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Jiho!	
Iron Claw!	
Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)	3
Jiho	
You got a couple of tickets to Veronica's live concert. Jiho seems to be interested.	
These are for you, of course. Here.	1
We're going to make it fair and gather everybody around so we can draw for the ticket.	3
I'll give you this, so get rid of that fake ticket.	
Jiho	
Jiho says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.	
I think you two have something in common...	
Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.	3
Hmm? That is odd... What do you think about this?	
Jiho	
With a serious look on her face, Jiho warns you to go to the bathroom before the match.	
Bathroom... It is indeed a very important matter...	3
Why does an ordinary advice sound so strange..	
I'm surprised you said that. I won't ask what happened to you.	
Jiho	
Jiho is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.	
It's all thanks to you.	
It's a result of team effort.	3
The opponents are mesmarized by the beauty of our players.	
	
Kevin	
Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Kevin seems to be sick of this.	
Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Kevin!	1
Iron Claw!	
Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)	3
Kevin	
Kevin is furious about how Lucian is always surrounded by girls. What should we say?	
Are you jealous?	-1
He's popular, just not as much as me.	3
He's good looking and has a good personality. Maybe that's why.	
Kevin	
It's a tough match, but Kevin is standing tall and encouraging the team. What should we say to him?	
You really help us a lot in these situations.	3
You're a good person.	
Your spirit is an inspiration to us all.	
Kevin	
Kevin looks sad because he feels his friendship with a friend in a rival team is falling apart. What should we say to him?	
It's not your fault. Let's try to find out why this is happening.	
Try starting off with some small talk.	
If your friend is truly your friend, he will understand.	3
Kevin	
The team is at Metro City. Kevin seems to be surprised how the people of Metro City have mechanical bodies.	
I like how they don't mind physical flaws.	3
I like how even the minority can be saved in this society.	-1
You have a heart of gold.	
Kevin	
Kevin refuses to listen to anybody's advice saying he's the best and he doesn't need any advice. Let's talk to him.	
Are you angry because I wasn't there to oversee your training? I said I'm sorry!	
Well that's absolutely fine if you can actually prove that you're the best.	3
That's not like you...	
Kevin	
Kevin seems to be uncomfortable to hear about the love life of other teammates. Let's talk to him.	
It's all good as long as it doesn't affect the match.	
Should we join the club?	
Just say it. You're jealous.	3
Kevin	
Kevin is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to him?	
That doesn't change what we must do.	3
Come on, cheer up. You're not being yourself.	-1
Stop whining. I like it better when you're arrogant and sarcastic.	
Kevin	
Kevin, who is determined to make everything in his life, even his dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.	
It was an intense feeling as if i was going against the strongest team in the universe.	1
I've never dreamt about soccer.	3
I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. it was terrifying	
Kevin	
The team seems very nervous facing Skalardra. What should we do?	
Hmm? What's wrong everybody?	3
Political power means nothing on the field.	1
Huh? I think Kevin is prettier.	-1
Kevin	
Kirin suddenly appears, pats Kevin on the head while teasing him, and then goes away. Kevin seems angry...	
He's like the wind. There wasn't even time to chat.	-1
...I think you liked it more than you thought...	
Patting you on the head? He must not fear for his life!	3
Kevin	
Kevin wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. He wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to him.	
I'm surprised you care so much for your friends.	
Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.	3
It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.	
Kevin	
Kevin wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?	
That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.	3
What about just watching?	
Sure. Let's beat them all and take the prize money!	-1
Kevin	
James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.	
...We should get out of here.	3
...It's about to go down...! Where's the popcorn?	-1
James and Bora...Who's the villain?	
Kevin	
Kevin is asking you what you think is it that makes this team great. You weren't expecting this, but you should give him an answer.	
We have a strong lineup of players that make our star players shine brighter.	3
Well, you're looking at the one person that is making this team great.	
You. I know you're doing much for the team without taking any credit.	-1
Kevin	
Kevin looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.	
It's space. Anything can exist here.	3
How about we ask Jeunese?	
Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.	
Kevin	
Kevin seems to be interested in the Micrinum from Kiri, which is said to be good for beauty and anti-aging. Let's talk to him.	
I think that's a good choice.	3
Looks aren't important when it comes to soccer.	1
You're young and good looking even without that.	1
Kevin	
The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Kevin to set some simple rules.	
The team is a mess. Gather everybody on the field. I'll knock that spirit back into you guys if I have to,	
Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.	3
Come on, I'll show you the best spots around!	
Kevin	
You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Kevin seems to be worried.	
Weakling. Should've been rougher on that player.	-1
It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during the match and it's not our fault.	3
Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.	
Kevin	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Kevin some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	
Make him know who he's up against.	
Let's try out some forward passes.	3
Kevin	
Kevin is spreading the happy news about his cousin having a baby. Let's congratulate him.	
Congratulations!	
So, the numerous baby clothes you've been making were all for this day?	-1
I hope that baby comes to be a great soccer player, just like you.	3
Kevin	
Kevin is interested in Selena and is asking for your opinion. What should we say?	
She's kind and sweet.  Maybe you'll have a shot?	
Be honest and show a sincere attitude.	
Considering your personality, I think she'll accept you.	3
Kevin	
It seems that Kevin is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?	
Listen carefully and you'll find him.	
Let's ask Khirel to find him...	
Kevin? Nah, he never gets lost.	3
Kevin	
Kevin, who has shown absolutely superb chemistry with you, is embarrassed and says he didn't do all of that because of you. What should we say?	
Stop being embarrassed and just accept the compliments, will you?	-1
Yeah?  Well, I did what I did for you.	-1
I know.	3
Kevin	
Kevin looks disappointed about the size of the Galaxy League. What would be an appropriate response?	
Nervous? Trust me. I got you.	
What were you expecting? An intergalactic war?	3
Isn't it awesome to see the galaxy come together for soccer?	
Kevin	
Kevin announces that he will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give him an answer.	
You'll have to compete with me!	
I feel bad for the players that have to face you.	
I have faith in you.	3
Kevin	
A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?	
I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!	
Don't kill him, okay?	
We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.	3
Kevin	
Kuma is furiously chasing Ogre. Kevin seems confused.	
Two bears... which one is kuma?	
Well,one thing is for sure.One of them did something stupid.	3
Looks like Orge is goofing around. I mean the gut has like over 200 pounds over Kuma.	
Kevin	
Kevin is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer him up?	
We'll find the ones that did this and use them as fertilizers.	
It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.	3
Who could've done such a hideous thing?	1
Kevin	
Kevin says he doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. He thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.	
I think you two have something in common...	-1
Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.	3
Hmm? That is odd... What do you think about this?	
Kevin	
You find Kevin lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?	
Hello! Have you come here buy food for dinner?	3
Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!	
Hmm, I guess you're more domestic than I thought.	
Kevin	
Kevin wants to have an academic conversation about the 5th dimension, string theory, and other infamously hard space theories. Why...?	
(He wants you to be a good listener.)	3
0	1
(May he brought snacks but is too shy to share it with me.)	
Kevin	
A teammate that is a former member of the Dark Sisters is down sick, suffering from the aftermath of performing exorcism. Let's talk with Kevin about what to do.	
Let's go visit her. Some fun won't do any harm. It might even cheer her up!	-1
Let's leave her alone. She may find all this attetion uncomfortable.	3
Let's be prepared to take care of her in case her sickness get worse.	-1
Kevin	
Kevin seems to be determined to crush the opposing team. Let's give him some advice.	
That's the spirit! Let's teach them a lesson!	
With your skills and dedications, I have no doubt that you will.	3
I like how you're doing your best.	
Kevin	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	3
Stop right there, pig!	
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	
Kevin	
Kevin came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.	
What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?	-1
I'm sure you got scammed.	-1
I hope that wasn't all you got.	3
Kevin	
Kevin caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?	
I think we should hang him.	
Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.	3
You came to see my marvelous moves? I'm flattered.	
Kevin	
Kevin is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give him an answer.	
We need a decent level of personal performance.	3
What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?	
Wreck the other team.	
Kevin	
Kevin is angry because he was criticized by his performance and is asking your opinion. Let's give him an answer.	
I want to practice with you, if that's okay with you. No?	
I admit it. You're the best in the team.	3
I'm sure the lessin here is that all of us need to learn.	-1
	
Nari	
The team manger ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?	
We could start a reset marathon.	
We're going to hunt that manager down and take back our money. We will show no mercy!	
Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.	3
Nari	
Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.	
The stage is so majestic! It's awesome!	-1
This proves that even the aliens like Nari.	
I think she's something more than just an idol.	
Nari	
Nari is looking excited and asks how the match went.	
The other team went home crying!	
They were a worthy opponent.	3
I led our team to victory with wedgies!	
Nari	
Nari is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.	
It's all thanks to you.	
It's a result of team effort.	3
The opponents are mesmarized by the beauty of our players.	
Nari	
The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.	
Let's see what you have to say after the match.	3
I didn't know I was a talented foot volleyball player!	
Care to receive the ball with your face?	
Nari	
With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Nari for solutions.	
We won't be able to win the league if we fail to overcome this.	
I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance	3
How about we put that advanced technology of Metro City to use 	-1
Nari	
Nari is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with Nari.	
I think we should come up with an action speed deck or go for counterattacks...	
I'll try to have the ball come your way.	-1
We can overcome this with team effort.	3
Nari	
Nari doesn't like the new team advertisement video.	
There's not enough fan service.	
It didn't portray your awesome performance.	
It didn't have to have the bench warmers in the video.	3
Nari	
The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?	
Manga, anime, and figures...! here I come!	1
It's time for some good food.	
I guess I can go to the soccer gear shop.	
	
Sam	
Sam is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.	
It's all thanks to you.	
It's a result of team effort.	3
The opponents are mesmerized by the beauty of our players.	
Sam	
Sam comes to you and says that he has to leave the team because of personal reasons. What should we say?	
Well, I don't want to be the one holding you back. Good luck!	
There will always be a place for you to return.	3
So, how does this work? Do I tap "Sell"?	
Sam	
Sam is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with Sam.	
I think we should come up with an action speed deck or go for counterattacks...	
I'll try to have the ball come your way.	-1
We can overcome this with team effort.	
Sam	
Sam is saying that his teammates are what keeps him going.	
(Put your thumbs up, wink, and send a juicy smile.)	3
(Pat him on the head.)	
(Just nod your head.)	
Sam	
The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?	
Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.	
We didn't play dirty, right?	
They will never learn with an attitude like that.	3
Sam	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Sam having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match.	3
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?	-1
...I see two idiots standing in front of me...	-1
Sam	
Sam brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...	1
Throw it away. NOW.	
Drink it up!	3
Sam	
Sam is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to him.	
I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.	
The fans love your performance!	3
Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.	
Sam	
With a serious look on his face, Sam warns you to go to the bathroom before the match.	
Bathroom... It is indeed a very important matter...	3
Why does an ordinary advice sound so strange..	
I'm surprised you said that. I won't ask what happened to you.	
Sam	
Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Sam is curious and wants to take a look.	
We should probably ignore them and just walk by.	
Let's go help them!	3
They must love volunteer work!	
Sam	
Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Sam on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?	
You and I are already perfect. So I guess that means we wouldn't be saying our names.	
I can't pick just one...	3
I think it should be you, but will you be able to return to your normal life after all of this...Wait, I'm going off topic, right?	
Sam	
Sam is impressed by the help he received from the elementals. Let's talk to him.	
The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.	
I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!	
I am so thankful to them.	1
Sam	
It's a very intense match and Sam falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Sam up and the two exchange smiles.	
Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?	
True sportsmanship! Wonderful!	3
That player must have a heart of gold.	
Sam	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	
Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.	1
Let's give them a hand.	
Sam	
Sam is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to him.	
I want you to form a team and catch every single bear near this locker room.	
If you want to say something, It's alright. I'll be listening.	
Let's go tell the manager.	1
	
Renee	
Renee hurt her leg during the 1st half of the match, but she insists on playing. What should we tell her?	
Don't push yourself too hard. There are alot of matches left.	1
Okay. You make them pay, understand?	3
It seems as if pain is what keeps you going...	-1
Renee	
Renee is having trouble focusing on the match because of the affectionate emotion she feels. She says she must leave now to propose to her lover. What should we say?	
You don't need to be the one being dragged around.	3
You will be happy, while that feeling lasts.	
Think about your teammates that are counting on you.	
Renee	
Renee did her best, but she failed to achieve the results she wanted and looks sad. We should say something to her.	
Sorry, I feel that this is on me.	3
That wasn't enough! You have to try harder!	
It's experiences like this that bonds us together.	
Renee	
You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Renee hands you a present.	
(A cute and pretty pendant)	
(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)	
(A chocker with a pretty radical design.)	1
Renee	
Renee says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.	
That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy and love.	
I think she likes him.	-1
Maybe she's up to something.	
Renee	
During the team meeting, you find a player sleeping. What should you do?	
(Leave it to Renee.)	3
(Slap the player in the back of the head.)	-1
(Wake the player up and continue with the meeting.)	1
Renee	
Renee is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle.	
You seem like the princess... Scratch that, the queen.	-1
She seems like a nice girl.	1
It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.	3
Renee	
Renee went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?	
We should think about how to make fun of her when she comes back.	3
I feel sorry for the other team.	1
Renee is in danger! We have to save her!	-1
Renee	
Renee blushes up and tells you that she's happy she can play soccer with you. What should we tell her?	
Me too. You're a good leader.	1
*Smiles bitterly*	3
Hmm, I'll prepare a rougher match.	-1
Renee	
Renee says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.	
Tell them they should remember that they play for you.	
Just hear them out and smile. They'll feel better.	1
You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.	3
Renee	
Renee is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.	
Life is a light of its own.	
That's deep. I think it's cool.	3
How about we make it to the top of the Galaxy League and shine the universe with the light within us?	
Renee	
Renee says that the soup tastes funny. What should we do?	
It's fine. Eat up.	
Let's stay away from the soup, just in case.	1
We shouldn't throw away food. Let's give it to somebody else.	3
Renee	
Renee says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?	
Of course! Everybody is counting on you!	-1
Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.	
I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.	1
Renee	
Renee says she's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.	
Is her name really Kiki?	3
Ask her if she likes you and if she wants to join our team.	
Tell her to be our lap cat.	-1
Renee	
It suddenly began to rain heavily. You see Renee running up ahead.	
(Catch up and share your umbrella)	1
(Let her steal your umbrella)	3
(Run past her and smile)	
Renee	
Renee seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?	
Congratulations! How did you guys get along?	1
Don't forget that we exist! Haha!	
Good for you! I know it's hard for you to find someone at your level!	1
Renee	
Renee looks excited as she's talking with the team about pets. She turns around and asks you what kind of pet you like.	
I think that a baby duck following its mother is one of the most adorable things to watch.	1
I like puppies. The loyal ones!	3
I like cats. I like the egoistic side of them.	-1
Renee	
Renee continues to charge into the opponent's defense line and keeps failing. What should we do?	
(Make a strategic decision.)	
(Guide her by kicking the ball toward the weak link in the opponent's defense.)	3
(She looks happy. Let's leave her be.)	
Renee	
It's dinner time and Renee is staring at her carrot soup with a troubled look. What should we do?	
(Eat it instead of her.)	
(Tell her to put the carrots in the soup on Hildegard's plate.)	
(Tell her that carrots are good for the body and to eat it all.)	
Renee	
Kuma is caught sneaking in the woman's locker room once again. We should talk with Renee about what to do with him.	
Let's make him put on Ogre's underwear.	3
Let's make him put on Renee's underwear.	
I'm not sure if it's save, but we can use him for leveling up.	-1
Renee	
Renee is furious about the referee that's clearly favoring the other team. Should we stop her?	
(Step on the referee's foot and pretend it was an accident)	3
The tougher it gets, the better it feels to win. Right?	-1
Ignore the referee. Focus on the match.	1
Renee	
Renee looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?	
Where do you think those comets are going?	1
Do you think any of those comets are populated?	3
The space has prepared a beautiful stage for you.	-1
Renee	
Renee wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.	
Beginner level monsters in an RPG game	3
Thankful beings that will be our +160	1
I'm planning to make a whole line of merchandise with them as the character	-1
Renee	
You witnessed a player on the other side putting a tack in Renee's shoe.	
(Ignore it.)	-1
(Remove the tack and tell the manager on the other team.)	
(Tell Renee who did this.)	3
Renee	
It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking up for the morning training. What should we tell Renee to do?	
They all need scolding.	-1
Wake them up. Kick them if you need to.	3
(Step on everyone that's still sleeping.)	
Renee	
Renee is asking you about what you like besides soccer.	
I like board games about war. I admire famous commanders.	1
Rugby, a sport of strength!	3
Boxing. I like that feeling when I get hit by a punch.	-1
Renee	
Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Renee is asking how she did in the match.	
You were picking the other team apart! It was awesome!	
It was pretty scary watching you so pleased with the rough plays of the opponents.	-1
You bring the best out of the team. Good work!	1
Renee	
Renee is being annoying with her offensive words. What should we do?	
(Slap her.)	
(Kick her out of the team if things can't be handled.)	1
(Ignore it.)	3
Renee	
Renee feels her heart races when she sees Littre.	
...Do you want to spend the rest of your life being with an abusive herbivore like alien creature?	-1
...Do you want a Superb Power-up?	-1
...That's not a rabbit.	3
Renee	
Renee is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.	
Do you think they're tasty?	
I think they're cute and elegant if you leave out the pig and the bear.	1
I'd like to keep one as a pet.	-1
Renee	
Renee claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?	
She must've made a mistake.	-1
Maybe Sophie is actually a male...?	3
I don't care what the case is.	1
Renee	
Renee asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give her a sincere answer.	
I guess I'll be chasing you on the road of glory.	
I want to see everybody smile. I think that'll make me happy.	
I'm going to make a joke before I start crying!	3
Renee	
Renee seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.	
Be careful not to be stomped on...	
We can do this! Let's go!	1
Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?	
Renee	
Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Renee seems to be troubled. What should we do?	
If you guys keep giving Renee trouble, I swear to god I'll use you both as special training material.	1
If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?	
You both need to be disciplined by Renee.	
Renee	
Renee says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.	
Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.	3
That's strange. I thought he was more of an authoritative character.	
Yeah, they get along pretty well.	-1
Renee	
Renee says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.	
It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry	
Did she think that you'll take over the throne?	
I sense that there's something she hasn't told us yet...	1
Renee	
You come across Renee thinking about the value of soccer. What should we tell her?	
I'm sure you can find pleasure inside of the violence of the field.	
The field is a ground of hopes and dreams. Isn't that enough?	3
I feel something when I overpower my opponents on the field.	
Renee	
Renee is asking for special training sessions because she's not satisfied with today's performance. What should we tell her?	
Good. I'll train you until you can't stand up	
If that's your wish.	
Sure. Let's get on to it.	3
Renee	
Renee is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?	
I don't think you need to worry about a diet.	1
You're playing soccer! You're fine!	
Please don't forget about the match.	
	
Roina	
The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?	
Manga, anime, and figures...! Here I come!	1
It's time for some good food.	
I guess I can go to the soccer gear shop.	
Roina	
Roina is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.	
He's just material for leveling up.	
I like how all of the Gate Keepers have different characteristics.	
That bear...Is a hero...!	-1
Roina	
Roina, who has shown absolutely superb chemistry with you, is embarrassed and says she didn't do all of that because of you. What should we say?	
Stop being embarrassed and just accept the compliments, will you?	
Yeah?  Well, I did what I did for you.	3
I know.	
Roina	
You see Roina's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Roina. What should we do?	
She is probably not even listening.	
Let's see how long they last. Come on guys!	3
Tell me if you like her. Just say the words and i'll scout her.	
Roina	
You got a couple of tickets to Veronica's live concert. Roina seems to be interested.	
These are for you, of course. Here.	
We're going to make it fair and gather everybody around so we can draw for the ticket.	
I'll give you this, so get rid of that fake ticket.	-1
Roina	
The team is at Metro City. Roina seems to be surprised how the people of Metro City have mechanical bodies.	
I like how they don't mind physical flaws.	
I like how even the minority can be saved in this society.	
You have a heart of gold.	3
Roina	
Roina seems to be uncomfortable to hear about the love life of other teammates. Let's talk to her.	
It's all good as long as it doesn't affect the match.	
Should we join the club?	3
Just say it. You're jealous.	
Roina	
Roina refuses to listen to anybody's advice saying he's the best and he doesn't need any advice. Let's talk to her.	
Are you angry because I wasn't there to oversee your training? I said I'm sorry!	
Well that's absolutely fine if you can actually prove that you're the best.	1
That's not like you...	
Roina	
After a meeting, Roina's eyes met yours a several times and Roina asks if she has something on her face.	
Yeah, Kuma's hat...	
I was just thinking the team became stronger, thanks to you.	1
I was just thinking about how much you do for the team.	3
Victoria	
Victoria announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.	
You'll have to compete with me!	3
I feel bad for the players that have to face you.	1
I have faith in you.	
Victoria	
The crowd is cheering for Victoria. Victoria seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.	
They're all in love with your enthusiastic play.	3
They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.	1
How about just accepting the compliments for today?	
Victoria	
Victoria has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.	
You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.	
Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it. You should keep that going.	3
I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.	
Victoria	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Victoria some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	3
Make him know who he's up against.	1
Let's try out some forward passes.	
Victoria	
Victoria caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?

You came to see my marvelous moves? I'm flattered.	3
Victoria

Victoria	
Victoria suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about a salad? I'm on a diet.	
How could you think about eating in a time like this? I'm dissapointed in you.	
Good idea. Let's go get some meat!	3
Victoria	
Victoria is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.	
The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.	
I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!	3
I am so thankful to them.	
Victoria	
Victoria is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?	
That doesn't change what we must do.	1
Come on, you're not being yourself.	3
Stop whining, I like it better when you're arrogant and sarcastic.	
Victoria	
Victoria lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?	
Well, this could have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you... 	
I will avenge you!	3
Victoria	
The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Victoria to set some simple rules.	
This team is a mess. Gather everybody on the feild. I'll knock that spirit back into you guys if I have to.	
Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.	
Come on, I'll show you the best spots around!	3
Victoria	
Victoria was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.

Victoria? Nah, she never get's lost	-1
Victoria	
As Victoria said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	3
Victoria	
You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Victoria seems to be worried.	
Weakling. Should've been rougher on that player.	
It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during the match and it's not our fault.	
Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.	3
Victoria	
A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Victoria.	
I feel like he's mocking us!	3
It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.	-1
He still has his two legs functioning, I see no problem with that.	1
Victoria	
Victoria brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.

Throw it away. NOW.	-1
Drink it up!	3
Victoria	
Victoria is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.

Wreck the other team.	
Victoria	
Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Victoria is curious and wants to take a look.

They must love volunteer work!	
Victoria	
It's a very intense match and Victoria falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Victoria up and the two exchange smiles.

Victoria	
Victoria is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.	
i hope this won't affect your performance on the field.	
The fans love your performance!.	3
Should've practiced that autograph like i told you.	
Victoria	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	1
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	3
Victoria	
Victoria came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.	
What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?	3
I'm sure you got scammed.	1

...It's about to go down...! Where's the popcorn?	3
James and Bora...Who's the villain?	
Victoria	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	
Stop right there, pig!	3
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	
Victoria	
You find Victoria lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?	
Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?	-1
Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!	3
Hmm, I guess you're more domestic than I thought.	
Victoria	
Victoria says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.	
I think you two have something in common...	-1
Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.	1
Hmm? That is odd... What do you think about this?	3
Victoria	
Victoria falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?	
If that's all you've got, just stay down. it's okay.	
Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!	3
Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.	
Victoria	
Victoria scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!

That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!	1
You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!	3
Victoria	
Victoria is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?	
We'll find the ones that did this and use them as fertilizers	-1
It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.	
Who could've done such a hideous thing?	3
Victoria

It's space. Anything can exist here.	-1
How about we ask Jeunese?	3
Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.	
Victoria	
Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Victoria seems to be sick of this.

Iron Claw!	
Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)	-1
Victoria	
Victoria wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.	
I'm surprised you care so much for your friends.	
Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.	-1
It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.	3
Victoria	
Victoria, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.	
It was an intense feeling as if I was going against the storngest team in the universe.	1
I've never dreamt about soccer.	
I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.	3
Victoria	
A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?	
I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!	3
Don't kill him, okay?	
We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.	
Victoria	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Victoria asks how you feel. How should we answer?

Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	1
Victoria	
Victoria wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?

Sure. Let's beat them all and take the prize money!	1
Victoria	
The team will not have a match for some time. Victoria asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.	3
Hmm, wanna go shopping?	-1
I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.	
Victoria	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Victoria having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match	3
How about solving this with a game of rock,scissors,paper?	
...I see two idiots standing in front of me...	
Sharr	
Sharr went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?	
We should think how to make fun of her when she comes back.	-1
I feel sorry for the other team.	3
Sharr is in danger! We need to rescue her!	
Sharr	
Sharr is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle.	
You seem like the princess... Scratch that, the queen.	3

You both need to be disciplined by Sharr.	3

How about we make it to the top of the Galaxy League and shine the universe with the light within us?	3
Sharr

Elaine wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.	
I'm surprised you care so much for your friends.	-1
Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.	3
It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.	-1
Elaine	
Elaine is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.	
I'll sleep by your side tonight.	3
I see. We must be careful. I'll be watching over you.	1
It's just a dream. Forget about it.	1
Elaine	
Elaine is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?	
We'll find the ones that did this and use them as fertilizers.	-1
It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.	3
Who could've done such a hideous thing?	1
Elaine	
Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Elaine seems to be sick of this.	
Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Elaine!	1
Iron Claw!	-1
Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)	3
Elaine	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Elaine some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	
Make him know who he's up against.	-1
Let's try out some forward passes.	3
Elaine	
You're watching the storm with Elaine and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.	
Is something troubling her? I'm having a bad feeling.	1
What's wrong with her?	-1
She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!	3
Elaine	
Elaine, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.	
It was an intense feeling as if i was going against the strongest team in the universe.	1
I've never dreamt about soccer.	3
I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.	-1
Elaine	
Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Elaine.	
I think he felt better because of the positive energy you always have around you.	1
Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?	-1
You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.	3
Elaine	
You find Elaine lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?	
Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?	3
Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!	-1
Hmm, I guess you're more domestic than i thought.	1
Elaine	
Elaine looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.	
Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.	3
Don't worry. Leave it up to me.	1
Littre will be fine.	-1
Elaine	
Elaine looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.	
It's space. Anything can exist here.	3
How about we ask Jeunese?	1
Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.	
Elaine	
Latios is chatting with Elaine after the match. Let's barge in.	
Don't think about sneaking her out. She's our pretty girl.	3
Elaine was fantastic on the field right?	1
I'm looking forward to our next match!	1
Elaine	
Elaine is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?	
You can overcome this like always. Right?	
It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.	3
Let's solve the problems one by one.	1
	
Choi	
The crowd is cheering for Choi. Choi seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help him out.	
They're all in love with your enthusiastic plays.	3
They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.	1
How about just acceping the compliments for today?	
Choi	
It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?	
I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.	-1
I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.	
Wow, congratulations! (Claps)	
Choi	
Choi scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate him!	
Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?	
That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!	1
You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!	3
Choi	
Choi has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. He is asking for your evaluation on his plays. Let's give him an answer.	
You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.	1
Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it. You should keep that going.	3
I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.	
Choi	
Choi's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next match. What should we say to him?	
If you keep it up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.	
Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.	3
Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.	
Choi	
During a match, Choi bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep on going.	1
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.	3
Choi	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	1
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	1
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	3
Choi	
Choi is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.	
It's surprising to see such advanced technology.	
Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.	3
Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.	
Choi	
Choi plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.	
I'm thinking of opening a shop.	
We'll see about it after the league.	
I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.	3
Choi	
Choi seems to be lost after having a good match while his fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to him.	
They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.	-1
It's just a myth. Forget about it.	1
Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.	3
Choi	
Choi seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see the problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.	1
I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great.	3
Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!	
Choi	
Choi is saying that his teammates are what keeps him going.	
(Put your thumbs up, wink, and send a juicy smile.)	3
(Pat him on the head.)	1
(Just nod your head.)	-1
Choi	
Choi is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to him.	
i hope this won't affect your performance on the field.	
The fans love your performance!.	3
Should've practiced that autograph like i told you.	
Choi	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Choi having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match.	3
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?	
...I see two idiots standing in front of me...	-1
Choi	
Choi was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin himself. Let's talk to him.	
oh, that'll be so cute	-1
it would be good to have one of each color, and when they 're all grown up.. Make 'em into good meal	
We can play soccer with penguins!	3
Choi	
Choi lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good. Can anybody give him some heals?	1
Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those swirlies like i told you...	
I will avenge you.	3
Choi	
The team is having a good run and Choi is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.	
Let's keep this momentum going!	3
As long as we're not used as training material...	-1
There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.	1
Choi	
You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!	
Cool! Awesome!	1
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	-1
...Uh...So no soccer?	3
Choi	
The team will not have a match for some time. Choi asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.	3
Hmm, wanna go shopping?	-1
I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.	1
Choi	
With a serious face, Choi is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give him an answer.	
Being together is enough for me.	3
A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?	1
Well, I'm sure we'll get an answer when we get to the end of this.	
Choi	
Choi brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...	
Throw it away. NOW.	
Drink it up!	3
Choi	
Choi is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.	
They're on cooldown.	
They support us from the shadows.	
Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one.  Right?	3
Choi	
Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Choi is curious and wants to take a look.	
We should probably ignore them and just walk by.	1
Let's go help them!	-1
They must love volunteer work!	-1
Choi	
As Choi said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to him.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	-1
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	3
Choi	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Choi asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel like I'm in heaven" or something?	-1
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	3
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	
Choi	
Choi came to you after the match, and says he's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	
Let's work up a solution.	1
I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.	3
Just please go with that boring strategy.	
Choi	
A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Choi.	
I feel like he's mocking us!	3
It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.	
He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.	1
Choi	
It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Choi and talk about what to do.	
We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.	3
I hope they have a "Continue" button around here.	
Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.	3
Choi	
Choi seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.	
Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.	
Maybe if you increase your Strength...	1
Don't be weak.	3
Choi	
It's a very intense match and Choi falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Choi up and the two exchange smiles.	
Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?	-1
True sportsmanship! Wonderful!	3
That player must have a heart of gold.	1
Choi	
You come across Sammy while walking the street with Choi. Let's talk to her.	
We'll win next time!	
Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.	1
(Ignore.)	
Choi	
Choi is impressed by the help he received from the elementals. Let's talk to him.	
The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.	
I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!	3
I am so thankful to them.	
Choi	
You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.	
If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.	1
I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.	
Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.	
Choi	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Choi is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.	3
He's obviously obsessed with soccer.	
This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their backline. 	1
Choi	
Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?	
The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!	3
Has he gone mad?	
I guess he's happy this is a good match.	1
Choi	
Choi suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about a salad? I'm on a diet.	
How could you think about eating in a time like this? I'm dissapointed in you.	
Good idea. Let's go get some meat!	3
Choi	
Choi is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.	
Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.	3
Well, having a good ace skill is a start.	
Flawless skills.	
Choi	
Choi is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?	
I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.	
All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.	
I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.	3
Choi	
Choi seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.	
The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.	1
Let's open up a bright future with this ball.	3
Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)	
Choi	
Choi is worried that he has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous things. What should we tell him?	
Look at the beautiful players! This is paradise!	
You're the most dangerous of them all.	
Makes it worth the challenge, don't you think so?	-1
Yuri	
Yuri claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?	
She must've made a mistake.	3
Maybe Sophie is actually a male...?	
I don't care what the case is.	
Yuri	
Yuri looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.	
Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.	
Don't worry. Leave it up to me.	
Littre will be fine.	3
Yuri	
Yuri went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?	
We should think about how to make fun of her when she comes back.	
I feel sorry for the other team.	
Yuri is in danger! We have to save her!	3
Yuri	
Yuri asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give her a sincere answer.	
I guess I'll be chasing you on the road of glory.	
I want to see everybody smile. I think that'll make me happy.	3
I'm going to make a joke before I start crying!	
Yuri	
Yuri's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Yuri seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.	
That player is just messing with you.	3
I think that play likes you.	
You're doing fine. Don't play your opponent's game.	1
Yuri	
Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Yuri seems to be troubled. What should we do?	
If you guys keep giving Yuri trouble, I swear to god I'll use you both as special training material.	3
If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?	
You both need to be disciplined by Yuri.	-1
Yuri	
Yuri is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?	
I don't think you need to worry about a diet.	1
You're playing soccer! You're fine!	3
Please don't forget about the match.	
Yuri	
The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Yuri and her opponent isn't over yet.	
You better win that fight!	3
Hey! The match is over!	
I've never seen her worked up that much.	
Yuri	
You come across Yuri who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?	
I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.	-1
Trust me and your teammates. Sit this one out.	-1
Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.	
Yuri	
Yuri is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle.	
You seem like the princess... Scratch that, the queen.	
She seem like a nice girl.	3
It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.	
Yuri	
A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Yuri. What should you say?	
Well, Yuri does have that kind of charm.	3
Well, you're as cute as Yuri.	
I hope you two become good rivals.	
Yuri	
The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Yuri do?	
Give her instructions so that she can do her share of the cleaning quickly.	
Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.	3
Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.	-1
Yuri	
You come across Yuri being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.	
Are you feeling alright?	3
Don't use that ability on the field...	
Don't worry, I'll go with you.	-1
Yuri	
Yuri says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.	
Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.	1
That's strange. I thought he was more of an authoritative character.	
Yeah, they get along pretty well.	3
Yuri	
You find Yuri depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.	
Don't mind it. It's our fault. We weren't able to make of your strength.	
You did well and i thank you for that.	3
It's not your fault that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!	
Yuri	
Yuri looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?	
Where do you think those comets are going?	3
Do you think any of those comets are populated?	
The space has prepared this beautiful stage for you.	1
Yuri	
Yuri says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.	
They're young but they have passion.	1
Yeah, I mean they could get hurt.	
Teach them how adults play soccer.	-1
Yuri	
Yuri is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?	
You can overcome this like always. Right?	3
It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opoonents off guard.	-1
Let's solve the problems one by one.	
Yuri	
The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?	
Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.	
We didn't play dirty, right?	
They will never learn with an attitude like that.	3
Yuri	
Yuri is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.	
I'm afraid to be honest.	
I was always looking forward for that moment.	3
Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes, will you?	
Yuri	
Yuri says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.	
That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy, and love.	
I think she likes him.	3
Maybe she's up to something.	
Yuri	
Yuri says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.	
Tell them they should remember that they play for you.	
Just hear them out and smile. They'll feel better.	3
You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.	
Yuri	
Yuri is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.	
I'll sleep by your side tonight.	-1
I see. We must be careful. I'll be watching over you.	-1
It's just a dream. Forget about it.	3
Yuri	
Yuri seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?	
Congratulations! How did you guys get along?	3
Don't forget that we exist! Haha!	
Good for you! I know it's hard for you to find someone at your level!	
Yuri	
Yuri seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.	
It's thanks to you! Thanks for listening to my instructions.	
I'm starting to see the true strengh in this team.	3
Perfect! No mistakes made!	
Yuri	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	-1
Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.	
Let's give them a hand.	
Yuri	
Yuri says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?	
Of course! Everybody is counting on you!	3
Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.	
I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.	
Yuri	
Yuri says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.	
It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry.	1
Did she think that you'll take over the throne?	
I sense that there's something she hasn't told us yet.	
	
William	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. William asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I Feel like I can fly" or something?	
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	1
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	
William	
During a match, William bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	-1
We have to keep on going.	1
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.	3
William	
William seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.	
The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.	
Let's open up a bright future with this ball.	3
Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)	
William	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	3
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	
William

Has he gone mad?	-1
I guess he's happy this is a good match.	1
William	
William is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to him.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	3
I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.	
Use this as a chance to enchance your condition.	1
William	
The team will not have a match for some time. William asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.	1
Hmm, wanna go shopping?	-1
I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.	3
William	
William falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to him?	
If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.	3
Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!	-1
Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.	-1
William	
William has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. He is asking for your evaluation on his plays. Let's give him an answer.

William lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good...Can anybody give him some heals?	1
Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those swirlies like I told you...	3
I will avenge you!	-1
William	
William seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.	1
I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great.	
Is there someone on the team that you like? Go propose!	-1
William	
William scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate him!	
Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?	
That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!	3
You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!	-1
William	
William seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.	
Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.	
Maybe if you increase your Strength	
Don't be weak.	3
William	
You come across Sammy while walking the street with William. Let's talk to her.	
We'll win next time!	
Do you also do fortune telling? I think i'm in love.	-1
(Ignore.)	3
William	
As William said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to him.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction	
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos	3
It's not a Galaxy Leauge. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	1
William	
With a serious face, William is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give him an answer.	
Being together is enough for me.	3
A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?	1
Well, I'm sure we'll get an answer when we get to the end of this.	1
William	
William suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.	
How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.	3
Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!	-1
William	
The team is having a good run and William is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.	
Let's keep this momentum going!	3
As long as we're not used as training material...	
There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.	
William	
You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!	
Cool! Awesome!	
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	
...Uh...So no soccer?	3
William	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across William having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match.	-1
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?	-1
...I see two idiots standing in front of me...	
	
Gaphyl	
Latios is chatting with Gaphyl after the match. Let's barge in.	
Don't you think about sneaking him out. He's our pretty boy.	-1
Gaphyl was fantastic on the field, right?	1
I'm looking forward to our next match!	3
Gaphyl	
The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Gaphyl and his opponent isn't over yet.	
You better win that fight!	3
Hey! The match is over!	
I've never seen him worked up that much.	
Gaphyl	
During a match, Gaphyl bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep on going.	3
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.	
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl seems to be lost after having a good match while his fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to him.	
They say the fortune telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.	
It's just a myth. Forget about it.	3
Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.	
Gaphyl	
You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!	
Cool! Awesome!	-1
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	3
...Uh...So no soccer?	
Gaphyl	
You come across Gaphyl being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to him.	
Are you feeling alright?	3
Don't use that ability on the field.	
Don't worry, I'll go with you.	
Gaphyl	
The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Gaphyl do?	
Give him instructions so that he can do his share of the cleaning quickly.	
Let him take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.	3
Let him clean, but warn him not to cause any trouble.	
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?	
I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.	-1
All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.	3
I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.	
Gaphyl	
You find Gaphyl depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer him up.	
Don't mind it. It's our fault. We weren't able to make use of your strength.	
You did well and I thank you for that.	3
It's not your fualt that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!	
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.	
The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.	3
Let's open up a bright future with this ball.	
Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)	
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.	
Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.	
Maybe if you increase your Strength...	3
Don't be weak.	1
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Gaphyl seems to be nervous. Let's talk to him.	
That player is just messing with you.	3
I think that player likes you.	
You're doing fine. Don't play your opponent's game.	1
Gaphyl	
Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Gaphyl.	
I think he felt better because of the positive energy you always have around you.	
Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?	3
You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.	
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl is stressed out saying his opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?	
You can overcome this like always. Right?	3
It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opoonents off guard.	
Let's solve the problems one by one.	1
Gaphyl	
A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Gaphyl. What should you say?	
Well, Gaphyl does have that kind of charm.	3
Well, you're as cute as Gaphyl.	
I hope you two become good rivals.	
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next match. What should we say to him?	
If you keep it up like that, you'd be able to play superbly in any postion.	3
Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.	1
Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.	
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.	
Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.	-1
Don't worry. Leave it up to me.	-1
Littre will be fine.	3
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl came to you after the match, and says he's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	
Let's work up a solution	3
I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.	
Just please go with that boring strategy.	
Gaphyl	
Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?	
The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!	
Has he gone mad?	-1
I guess he's happy this is a good match.	3
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to him.	
It's thanks to you! Thanks for listening to my instructions.	
I'm starting to see true strength in this team.	
Perfect! No mistakes made!	-1
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.	
They're on cooldown.	
They support us from the shadows.	
Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one.  Right?	1
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.	
Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes. You're a precious part of this team.	
Don't be anxious. Have faith and keep following me.	
That's why I need your help.	3
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give him an answer.	
I'm afraid to be honest.	
I was always looking forward for that moment.	
Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes, will you?	1
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.	
I'm thinking of opening a shop.	-1
We'll see about it after the League.	3
I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.	-1
Gaphyl	
You come across Gaphyl who is limping. He says it's nothing. What should we do?	
I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.	
Trust me and your teammates. Sit this one out.	-1
Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.	3
Gaphyl	
You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.	
If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.	
I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.	1
Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.	-1
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to him.	
I'll sleep by your side tonight.	-1
I see. We must be careful. I'll be watching over you.	-1
It's just a dream. Forget about it.	
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to him.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	
I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time	-1
Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.	3
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see the problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.	3
I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great.	
Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!	
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.	
Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.	1
Well, having a good ace skill is a start.	
Flawless skills.	3
Gaphyl	
You're watching the storm with Gaphyl and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.	
Is something troubling her? I'm having a bad feeling.	-1
What's wrong with her?	
She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!	-1
Gaphyl	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	-1
Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.	
Let's give them a hand.	
Gaphyl	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Gaphyl is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.	1
He's obviously obsessed with soccer.	
This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their backline. 	
Gaphyl	
Gaphyl is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.	
It's surprising to see such advanced technology.	3
Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.	
Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.	-1
Gaphyl	
It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Gaphyl and talk about what to do.	
We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.	-1
I hope they have a "Continue" button around here.	
Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.	3
	
Bora	
Bora announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.	
You'll have to compete with me!	
I feel bad for the players that have to face you.	
I have faith in you.	3
Bora	
Bora plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.	
I'm thinking of opening a shop.	
We'll see about it after the League	-1
I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.	3
Bora	
Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Bora seems to be sick of this.	
Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Bora!	
Iron Claw!	-1
Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)	
Bora	
Bora, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.	
It was an intense feeling as if i was going against the strongest team in the universe.	1
I've never dreamt about soccer	
I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.	
Bora	
Bora is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	
I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time	
Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.	1
Bora	
Bora wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?	
That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.	
What about just watching?	
Sure.Let's beat them all and take the prize money!	-1
Bora	
It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Bora and talk about what to do.	
We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.	3
I hope they have a "continue" button around here.	
Let's come up with a plan after this match.	
Bora	
With a serious face, Bora is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.

Just please go with that boring strategy.	
Bora	
Bora is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?	
I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.	
All I care is that he's an excellent trainer.	
I can tell he's a very dilligent person that always tries his best.	3
Bora	
During a match, Bora bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep on going	
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.	3
Lia	
Lia says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.	
Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.	
That's stange. I thought he was more of an authoritative character	
Yeah, they get along pretty well.	3
Lia	
You come across Lia being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.	
Are you feeling alright?	1
Don't use that ability on the field.	3
Don't worry, I'll go with you.	1
Lia	
You come across Lia who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?

Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.	-1
Lia	
Lia says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.	
It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry	1
Did she think that you'll take over the throne?	
I sense that there's something she hasn't told us yet...	3
Lia	
Lia says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.	
They're young but they have passion.	1
Yeah, I mean they could get hurt.	
Teach them how adults play soccer.	-1
Lia	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	3

I see. We must be careful. I'll be watching over you.	1
It's just a dream. Forget about it.	
Lia	
The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?	
Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.	
We didn't play dirty, right?	1
They will never learn with an attitude like that.	
Lia	
Lia is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.	
I'm afraid to be honest.	
I was always looking forward for that moment.	
Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes, will you?	3
Lia	
Lia is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.	
Life is a light of its own.	3
That's deep. I think it's cool.	-1
How about we make it to the top of the Galaxy League and shine the universe with the light within us.	1
Lia	
Lia is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.	
Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes. You're a precious part of this team.	3

Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?	
You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.	3
Lia	
Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Lia seems to be troubled. What should we do?	
If you guys keep giving Lia trouble, I swear to god I'll use you both as special training material.	3
If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?	-1
You both need to be disciplined by Lia.	-1
Lia	
Lia seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.	
Be careful not to be stomped on...	
We can do this! Let's go!	3
Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?	
Lia	
Lia wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.	
Beginner level monsters in an RPG game.	-1
Thankful beings that will be our +160.	-1
I'm planning to make a whole line of merchandise with them as the character.	3
Lia	
You're watching the storm with Lia and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.	
Is something troubling her? I'm having a bad feeling.	
What's wrong with her?	-1
She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!	
Lia	
Lia is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?	
Don't worry about me! Do your job!	1
Can you peel this guy off of me?	-1
Don't come over here! It's dangerous!	
Lia	
Lia says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.	
That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy and love.	-1
I think she likes him.	3
Maybe she's up to something.	-1
Lia	
You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Lia hands you a present.	
(A cute and pretty pendant)	3
(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)	
(A choker with a pretty radical design.)	
Lia	
Latios is chatting with Lia after the match. Let's barge in.	
Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's our pretty girl	3
Lia was fantastic on the field, right?	1
I'm looking forward to our next match!	
Lia	
The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Lia do?

Tell her to be our lapcat.	3
Lia	
Lia seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.	
It's thanks to you! Thanks for listening to my instructions!	1
I'm starting to see true strength in this team.	1
Perfect! No mistakes made!	
Lia	
A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Lia. What should you say?	
Well, Lia does have that kind of charm.	
Well, you're as cute as Lia.	3
I hope you two become good rivals.	
Lia	
Lia claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?	
She must've made a mistake.	3
Maybe Sophie is actually a male...?	1
I don't care what the case is.	
Lia	
Lia says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.	
Tell them they should remember that they play for you.	
Just hear them out and smile. They'll feel better.	3
You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.	1
Lia	
The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Lia and her opponent isn't over yet.	
You better win that fight!	-1
Hey! The match is over!	3
I've never seen her worked up that much.	
Lia	
Lia seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?	
Congratulations! How did you guys get along?	
Don't forget that we exist! Haha!	
Good for you! I know it's hard for you to find someone at your level!	-1
Lia	
Lia looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.	
Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.	
Don't worry. Leave it up to me.	
Littre will be fine.	-1
Lia	
Lia is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?	
You can overcome this like always. Right?	-1
It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.	
Let's solve the problems one by one.	
	
Lucian	
You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Lucian hands you a present.	
(A cute and pretty pendant)	1
(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)	3
(A choker with a pretty radical design.)	
Lucian	
Lucian, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal what your agenda really is. What should we say?	
To become the strongest being in space! I shall tramp on everything that stands in my path!	-1
Just playing soccer, that's all.	1
To bring justice with soccer. That's all.	
Lucian	
Lucian says he's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.	
Is her name really Kiki?	
Ask her if she likes you and if she wants to join our team.	-1
Tell her to be our lap cat.	-1
Lucian	
You come across Lucian, who was overwhelmed by his opponent throughout the game. Let's cheer him up.	
Those scumbags played dirty. Ugh, I'm angry!	
I should step on the player's foot next time. 	-1
I'm proud that you played your game and didn't descend to the opponents level.	1
Lucian	
Lucian is thinking about what the Universe of Oblivion is.	
Don't be scared about such petty things.	
I don't like the word oblivion.	3
I don't care as long as it doesn't harm me.	
Lucian	
Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Lucian wants to say a word.	
Get yourselves together, guys. Are you going to give up already?	
Come on guys, you know it's an exciting thing to be playing against a strong team! Keep your heads up high!	3
They will be sacrificed for our victory and honor.	
Lucian	
Lucian is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle.	
You seem like the princess... Scratch that, the queen.	-1
She seems like a nice girl.	1
It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.	3
Lucian	
Lucian is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.	
Do you think they're tasty?	3
I think they're cute and elegant if you leave out the pig and the bear.	
I'd like to keep one as a pet.	
Lucian	
Lucian says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.	
Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team	3
That's strange. I thought he was more of an authoritative character.	1
Yeah, they get along pretty well.	-1
Lucian	
Lucian is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.	
If you're better than your teammates, you should be the one to be considerate.	-1
I'm not comfortable with this converstation.	3
He can be irritating.	-1
Lucian	
Lucian is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''	
Not again...	
Let's do this! I'm at your disposal!	1
I like what you just said.	3
Lucian	
You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?	
I feel sorry, but that's irrelevant to the match.	3
This is going to be a cake walk.	-1
I'm considering making an anonymous donation.	
Lucian	
Lucian is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?	
I don't think you need to worry about a diet.	1
You're playing soccer!  You're fine!	
Please don't forget about the match.	
Lucian	
Lucian says he's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give him an answer.	
They're young but they have passion.	1
Yeah, I mean they could get hurt.	
Teach them how adults play soccer.	3
Lucian	
Lucian is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to him.	
Life is a light of its own.	
That's deep. I think it's cool.	
How about we make it to the top of the Galaxy League and shine the universe with the light within us?	1
Lucian	
Lucian says that Bell seemed depressed when he told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.	
It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry.	3
Did she think that you'll take over the throne?	-1
I sense that there's something she hasn't told us yet...	1
Lucian	
Lucian seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell him?	
Congratulations! How did you guys get along?	1
Don't forget that we exist! Haha!	3
Good for you! I know it's hard for you to find someone at your level!	
Lucian	
Lucian went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?	
We should think about how to make fun of him when he comes back.	3
I feel sorry for the other team.	1
Lucian is in danger! We have to save him	-1
Lucian	
You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.	
How can I earn gold? Where do I have to go to find the REAL Underground?	-1
It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.	
So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.	
Lucian	
Lucian says he was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.	
Tell them they should remember that they play for you.	
Just hear them out and smile. They'll feel better.	1
You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.	3
Lucian	
Lucian says that he thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give him an answer.	
That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy, and love.	
I think she likes him.	-1
Maybe she's up to something.	3
Lucian	
Lucian says he's the center of the team and asks if you agree with him. How should we answer?	
Of course! Everybody is counting on you!	-1
Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.	3
I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.	1
Lucian	
Let's talk to Lucian who recently started to take interest in the world of angels.	
It's a place to rest for the good.	3
I'm sure it'd be full of hypocrites.	
I hope it's not a boring place.	
Lucian	
Lucian seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.	
Be careful not to be stomped on...	
We can do this! Let's go!	
Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?	3
Lucian	
Cracsus threatens to hack Lucian's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?	
Let's blackmail Robin that we'll pluck out all of his plants.	
I contacted Hildegard.	
Don't fall for this cheap shot.	3
Lucian	
Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?	
We will confront them fair and square, and win.	3
I'll go blow up their lodging.	
Pathetic. We'll show them that we're better in many ways.	
Lucian	
Lucian asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give him a sincere answer.	
I guess I'll be chasing you on the road of glory.	1
I want to see everybody smile. I think that'll make me happy.	-1
I'm going to make a joke before I start crying!	
Lucian	
Lucian is asking you if you ever saw the World Tree. Let's tell him your thoughts.	
Let's not talking about anything irrelevant to the match.	-1
It's something I'd want to see again with a person I care.	3
It's nothing but a tree.	-1
Lucian	
Lucian claims he saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?	
She must`ve made a mistake.	
Maybe Sophie is actually a male...?	3
I don`t care what the case is.	1
Lucian	
Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Lucian seems to be troubled. What should we do?	
If you guys keep giving Lucian trouble, I swear to god I'll use you both as special training material.	
If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?	3
You both need to be disciplined by Lucian.	
Lucian	
The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?	
A square match is what suites a proud royalty.	1
Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?	3
That has nothing to do with us.	
Lucian	
You're having a conversation with Lucian about the power of Spirit Stones which is covered in secrets. Let's tell him what you think.	
I need a Spirit Stone that's as fancy as I am.	1
I won't rely on Spirit Stones.	
I would buy them all if I could.	1
Lucian	
Lucian is thinking about what Selena said about saving the galaxy if we win the Galaxy League.	
Then we should do our very best to win.	3
I can play along if there's something in it for me.	
It's not good to believe what others say.	
	
Yeon	
Yeon is having trouble finding a Spirit Stone that fits her needs and taste. Let's give her advice.	
How about Metatron's Will? It's cute with the butterfly decorations.	
I recommend Paradise of Light.	
What about Silent Cold? You'll be able to hold on to your opponents.	3
Yeon	
Yeon thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?	
First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.	
Of course we should tell Lynbell! What are you waiting for?	
...Sometimes, the truth is better to be left a secret.	3
Yeon	
Yeon says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.	
It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry.	
Did she think that you'll take over the throne?	
I sense there's something she hasn't told us yet...	3
Yeon	
You're talking to Yeon about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow. Let's tell her your answer.	
I would say goodbye to all my friends.	1
If it's the end of the world, I'd pull off a crazy performance in a densely populated area before I go!	
Hmm, there's a guy I'd like to beat up before I die.	
Yeon	
Yeon is planning to go on a blind date with a close teammate. Should we say something to her?	
Just stay out of trouble.	
Come talk to me before you fall in love at first sight.	3
Don't get greedy and go for all of the men.	
	
Susie	
Susie is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.	
I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.	
The fans love your performance!	1
Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.	
Susie	
Susie comes to you and says that she has to leave the team because of personal reasons. What should we say?	
Well, I don't want to be the one holding you back. Good luck!	
There will always be a place for you to return.	3
So, how does this work? Do I tap "Sell"?	
Susie	
Susie is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.	
He's just material for leveling up.	-1
I like how all the Gate Keepers have different characteristics.	3
That bear...Is a hero...!	
	
Jayce	
Jayce is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with Jayce.	
I think we should come up witth an action speed deck or go for counterattcks...	
I'll try to have the ball come your way.	3
We can overcome this with team effort.	
	
Shu	
Shu is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Iron Canyon.	
I want one of those. It'll be fun to have a pet dragon.	3
I can feel the strength of that majestic creature.	
Hmm... If only I could change the shape of the horned and the color of the scales. That'd be perfect.	
Shu	
Shu seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. He seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?	
It's within our grasp.	
I would like to hear what you think is the best team in the universe.	1
(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)	3
Shu	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Shu is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.	
He's obviously obsessed with soccer.	
This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.	1
Shu	
Shu plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.	
I'm thinking of opening a shop.	
We'll see about it after the league.	
I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.	3
Shu	
You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!	
Cool! Awesome!	1
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	-1
...Uh...So no soccer?	3
Shu	
During a match, Shu bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep on going.	
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.	3
Shu	
Shu seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.	
Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.	-1
Maybe if you increase your Strength...	1
Don't be weak.	3
Shu	
There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?	
What's done is done. Let's come up with a new design.	1
It's finally time for some festival-soccer!	
Let's split up and find the uniforms.	
Shu	
Shu seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to him.	
Everybody should grow up.	
It'll be alright. Don't worry.	
Let's go look for him.	1
Shu	
Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give him some advice.	
Is winning really worth going that far?	
I don't see anything wrong as long as you can get away with it.	3
Be true to yourself.	
Shu	
Shu is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.	
Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.	
Well, having a good ace skill is a start.	3
Flawless skills.	
Shu	
Shu is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell him?	
To win all the way, of course.	3
Best of 4 should be our goal.	
Teamwork is what matters the most.	
Shu	
You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.	
If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.	
I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.	3
Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.	
Shu	
The team is saying bad things about Shu for skipping practice. Time to intervene.	
Do you really think that he would skip practice?	
Skipping practice isn't something that's in his disctionary.	
His love towards soccer is real.	3
Shu	
Shu came to you after the match, and says he's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	
Let's work up a solution.	1
I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.	
Just please go with that boring strategy.	
Shu	
On a day off, Shu is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.	
I´d love to have a stable job first.	
It´s really hard to find the right person.	1
If you find a beautiful woman, try talking to her!	3
Shu	
Shu is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.	
It's surprising to see such advanced technology.	
Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.	3
Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.	-1
Shu	
Shu is making a scene. He'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.	
Vicious? More like ugly.	
The door's over there.	
Are you giving up before putting up a fight?	1
Shu	
Shu is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to him?	
How about we play baseball today?	
No,It's not boring.	-1
If you're up for suggestion,I'm all ears.	
Shu	
Shu is having trouble deciding a name for his special move. His options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.	
I'm sure you're going to become an intergalactic fool.	
I...Respect your naming taste...	
Cool! Keep it up!	3
Shu	
Shu is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to him.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	
I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.	-1
Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.	
Lemy	
Lemy is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?	
Don't worry about me! Do your job!	
Can you peel this guy off me?	3
Don't come over here! It's dangerous!	
Lemy	
Lemy is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.	
I'll sleep by your side tonight.	
I see. We must be careful. I'll be watching over you.	-1
It's just a dream. Forget about it.	
	
Erica	
The crowd is cheering for Erica. Erica seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.	
They're all in love with your enthusiastic play.	
They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.	3
How about just accepting the compliments for today?	
Erica	
Erica says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.	
It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry	
Did she think that you'll take over the throne?	
I sense that there's something she hasn't told us yet...	3
Erica	
Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Erica is curious and wants to take a look.	
We should probably ignore them and just walk by.	-1
Let's go help them!	
They must love volunteer work!	
Erica	
The team will not have a match for some time. Erica asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.	-1
Hmm, wanna go shopping?	
I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.	
Erica	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Erica asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I Feel like I can fly" or something?	
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	1
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	
Erica	
Erica brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drink looks really scary... But we can't just throw it away...	3
Throw it away. NOW.	
Drink it up!	
Erica	
Erica is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.	
Do you think they'll be tasty?	
I think they're cute and elegant if you leave out the pig and bear.	1
I'd like to keep one as a pet.	3
Erica	
You come across Sammy while walking the street with Erica. Let's talk to her.	
We'll win next time!	
Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.	
(Ignore.)	
Erica	
Erica falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?	
If that's all you got, just stay down. It's okay.	
Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!	
Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.	3
Erica	
Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Erica seems to be troubled. What should we do?	
If you guys keep giving Sharr trouble, I swear to god I'll use you both as special training material.	3
If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?	
You both need to be disciplined by Sharr.	
Erica	
Erica says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.	
Tell them they should remember that they play for you.	
Just hear them out and smile. They'll feel better.	3
You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.	1
Erica	
Erica seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?	
Congratulations! How did you guys get along?	
Don't forget that we exist! Haha!	1
Good for you! I know it's hard for you to find someone at your level!	
Erica	
Erica suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about a salad? I'm on a diet.	
How could you think about eating in a time like this? I'm dissapointed in you.	
Good idea. Let's go get some meat!	1
Erica	
Erica is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.	
I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.	
The fans love your performance!	1
Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.	
Erica	
Erica went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?	
We should think about how to make fun of her when she comes back.	
I feel sorry for the other team.	
Erica is in danger! We need to save her!	3
Erica	
Erica scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!	
Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?	
That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!	-1
You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!	
Erica	
Erica is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.	
(Put your thumbs up, wink, and send a juicy smile.)	
(Pat her on the head.)	3
(Just nod your head.)	
Erica	
A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Erica.	
I feel like he's mocking us!	-1
It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.	
He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.	
	
Lucius	
The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?	
Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.	
We didn't play dirty, right?	
They will never learn with an attitude like that.	3
	
Kyoko	
Kyoko is asking you about what you like besides soccer.	
I like board games about war. I admire famous commanders.	
Rugby, a sport of strength!	
Boxing. I like that feeling when I get hit by a punch.	-1
Kyoko	
Kyoko says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.	
Tell them they should remember that they play for you.	
Just hear them out and smile. They'll feel better.	
You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep  things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.	3
Kyoko	
Kyoko is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?	
I don't think you need to worry about a diet.	1
You're playing soccer! You're fine!	
Please don't forget about the match.	
Kyoko	
Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Kyoko is asking how she did in the match.	
You were micking the other team apart! It was awesome!	
It was pretty scary watching you so pleased with the rough plays of the opponents.	
You bring the best out of the team. Good work!	1
Kyoko	
Kyoko says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?	
Of course! Everybody is counting on you!	-1
Well, your sarcastic jokes are essential part of the team's strength.	
I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.	
Kyoko	
Kyoko claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?	
She must've made a mistake.	
Maybe Sophie is actually a male...?	
I don't care what the case is.	1
	
Sue	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	
Stop right there, pig!	
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	-1
Sue	
Sue seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?	
I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.	3
The eyepatch...I wonder if she washes it.  She seems to have it on at all times.	1
That's a dangerous secret you're trying to find out about.  Do you still want to know?	
Sue	
Sue is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?	
It's the place where the chosen ones learn about their destiny.	-1
It's the place of dreams colliding.	
It's stressful because we can't prepare for extraterrestrial sanitation.  We're completely exposed to all those unknown...things.	
Sue	
Sue is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.	
Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.	
It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy! This is nonsense!	
We haven't awakened our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyond!	-1
Sue	
The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Sue to set some simple rules.	
This team is a mess. Gather everybody on the field. I'll knock that spirit back into you guys if I have to.	
Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.	1
Come on, I'll show you the best spots around!	
Sue	
Sue is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.	
This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!	1
Gate Keeper dolls!  Why not!	
How about some presents for your parents?	
	
Tyler	
Tyler picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.	
So, this is how the revelation begins!	
Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...	
Let's contact her and return this.	1
Tyler	
Tyler thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.	
That's because you haven't opened up your "third eye"!	
Isn't that the same with all other Beastmen?	3
Hmm, her tail is a bit weird and her ears are definitely human...	
Tyler	
Tyler says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.	
Hmm, a revived person that forgot his purpose...Reminds me of somebody.	-1
He'll remember someday.	
That's bad. I'm sure it was something important!	
Tyler	
Tyler is saying that his teammates are what keeps him going.	
(Put your thumbs up, wink, and send a juicy smile.)	3
(Pat him on the head.)	
(Just nod your head.)	
Tyler	
Tyler suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about a salad? I'm on a diet.	
How could you think about eating in a time like this? I'm dissapointed in you.	
Good idea. Let's go get some meat!	3
Tyler	
Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Tyler is curious and wants to take a look.	
We should probably ignore them and just walk by.	
Let's go help them!	3
They must love volunteer work!	
	
Jacob	
Jacob is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to him.	
It's silly of you to worry about such things. Are you feeling okay?	-1
We must have faith in the Gate Keepers and win the Galaxy League.	3
A mysterious villian... Bad taste, if you ask me.	
Jacob	
Jacob is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.	
I would've tried to find something that fits me.	
Something full of excitement!	-1
I would've been doing something to save the universe.	3
Jacob	
You forgot to lock Jacob and almost used him as training material! He looks very upset!	
It's my fault.	
It was all just to motivate you to become a bettter player.	
It's your fault.	1
Jacob	
You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.	
If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.	3
I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.	1
Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.	
Jacob	
Jacob is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?	
(I want every day to be exciting and fun.)	
(I just don't want to waste a single day in my life.)	3
(I want my dreams to come true.)	1
Jacob	
It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Jacob and talk about what to do.	
We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.	-1
I hope they have a "Continue" button around here.	-1
Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.	
Jacob	
Jacob is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?	
I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.	-1
All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.	
I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.	
Jacob	
Jacob seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. He seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?	
It's within our grasp.	3
I would like to hear what you think is the best team in the universe.	
(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)	
Jacob	
Jacob seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.	
Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones	-1
Maybe if you increase your Strenght...	3
Don't be weak	
Jacob	
Jacob seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.	3
I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great.	
Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!	
	
Hyun	
A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Hyun. What should you say?	
Well, Hyun does have that kind of charm.	3
Well, you're as cute as Hyun.	
I hope you two become good rivals.	
	
Lina	
The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Lina and her opponent isn't over yet.	
You better win that fight!	3
Hey! The match is over!	
I've never seen her worked up that much.	
	
Jean	
Jean seems to be determined to crush the opposing team. Let's give him some advice.	
That's the spirit! Let's teach them a lesson!	1
With your skills and dedication, I have no doubt that you will.	
I like how you're doing your best.	
Jean	
You come across Jean being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to him.	
Are you feeling alright?	
Don't use that ability on the field...	
Don't worry, I'll go with you.	-1
Jean	
A teammate that is a former member of the Dark Sisters is down sick, suffering from the aftermath of performing exorcism. Let's talk with Jean about what to do.	
Let's go visit her. Some fun won't do any harm. It might even cheer her up!	-1
Let's leave her alone. She may find all this attetion uncomfortable.	
Let's be prepared to take care of her in case her sickness get worse.	-1
Jean	
Jean is spreading the happy news about his cousin having a baby. Let's congratulate him.	
Congratulations!	
So, the numerous baby clothes you've been making were all for this day?	
I hope that baby comes to be a great soccer player, just like you.	3
Jean	
Jean refuses to listen to anybody's advice saying he's the best and he doesn't need any advice. Let's talk to him.	
Are you angry because I wasn't there to oversee your training? I said I'm sorry!	
Well that's absolutely fine if you can actually prove that your're the best.	3
That's not like you...	
Jean	
It's a tough match, but Jean is standing tall and encouraging the team. What should we say to him?	
You really help us a lot in these situations.	3
You're a good person.	
Your spirit is an inspiration to us all.	
	
Akane	
Akane is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.	
Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.	1
Well, having a good ace skill is a start.	
Flawless skills.	-1
Akane	
Akane is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?	
(I want every day to be exciting and fun.)	
(I just don't want to waste a single day in my life.)	
(I want my dreams to come true.)	-1
Akane	
Akane came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	
Let's work up a solution.	1
I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.	
Just please go with that boring strategy.	
Akane	
Akane is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing any problems.	
You're right. This is a waste of time.	
The honor of our opponent is also important.	3
That team is far from your style.	
Akane	
With a serious face, Akane is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.	
Being together is enough for me	
Away that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?	3
Well, I'm sure we'll get an answer when we get to the end of this.	
Akane	
It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Akane and talk about what to do.	
We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.	
I hope they have a "Continue" button around here.	
Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.	-1
Akane	
Akane is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?	
I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.	
All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.	
I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.	-1
Akane	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Akane is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.	-1
He's obviously obsessed with soccer.	
This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their backline. 	
Akane	
The team is saying bad things about Akane for skipping practice. Time to intervene.	
Do you really think that she would skip practice?	
Skipping practice isn't something that's in her dictionary.	
Her love towards soccer is real.	-1
Akane	
During a match, Akane bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep on going.	
It's something happened during the match. Don"t be so hard on yourself.	-1
Akane	
You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.	
If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.	-1
I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.	
Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.	
Akane	
Akane seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.	-1
I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great.	1
Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!	
Akane	
The team is having a good run and Akane is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.	
Let's keep this momentum going!	1
As long as we're not used as training material...	
There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.	-1
Akane	
Akane plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.	
I'm thinking of opening a shop.	
We'll see about it after the league.	
I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.	-1
	
Naomi	
Naomi seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.	
Be careful not to be stomped on...	
We can do this! Let's go!	3
Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?	
Naomi	
Naomi went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?	
We should think about how to make fun of her when she comes back.	
I feel sorry for the other team.	
Naomi is in danger! We have to save her!	3
 	
Brett	
As Brett said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to him.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	3
Brett	
Brett is having trouble deciding a name for his special move. His options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.	
I'm sure you're going to become an intergalatic fool.	
I...Respect your naming taste...	
Cool! Keep it up!	1
Brett	
Brett is confused that he won the MVP. What should you tell him?	
Nicely done! We're throwing a party today!	
You deserve it. Well done!	3
Aren't you satisfied with your performance?	
Brett	
Brett is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell him?	
To win all the way, of course.	
Best of 4 should be our goal.	
Teamwork is what matters the most.	1
	
Yuran	
Yuran looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.	
Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.	
Don't worry. Leave it up to me.	1
Littre will be fine.	
	
Wayne	
Wayne wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. He wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to him.	
I'm surprised you care so much for your friends.	
Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.	
It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.	-1
Wayne	
Wayne seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to him.	
	1
I'm starting to see the true strengh in this team.	
Perfect! No mistakes made!	
	
Nari	
Nari is having trouble finding a Spirit Stone that fits her needs and taste. Let's give her advice.	
How about Metatron's Will? It's cute with the butterfly decorations.	
I recommend Paradise of Light.	
What about Silent Cold? You'll be able to hold on to your opponents.	-1
Sage	
The crowd is cheering for Sage. Sage seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help him out.	
They're all in love with your enthusiastic plays.	1
They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.	
How about just acceping the compliments for today?	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	
Let's work up a solution.	3
I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.	-1
Just please go with that boring strategy.	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.	
You'll have to compete with me!	-1
I feel bad for the players that have to face you.	
I have faith in you.	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.	
It's space. Anything can exists here.	3
How about we ask Jeunese?	1
Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.	-1
MX83 Askeladd	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Askeladd some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	-1
Make him know who he's up against.	-1
Let's try out some forward passes.	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.	
I think you two have something in common...	-1
Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.	3
Bell	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	1
I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.	
Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.	
MX83 Askeladd	
It seems that Askeladd is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?	
Listen carefully and you'll find her.	-1
Let's ask Khirel to find her...	-1
Askeladd? Nah, she never gets lost.	3
MX83 Askeladd	
James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.	
...We should get out of here.	3
...It's about to go down...! Where's the popcorn?	-1
James and Bora...Who's the villain?	-1
MX83 Askeladd	
You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Askeladd seems to be worried.	
Weakling. Should've been rougher on that player.	-1
It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.	3
Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.	
What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?	-1
I'm sure you got scammed.	-1
I hope that wasn't all you got.	
MX83 Askeladd	
You're talking to Askeladd about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow. Let's tell her your answer.	
I would say goodbye to all my friends.	3
If it's the end of the world, I'd pull of a crazy performance in a densely populated area before I go!	
Hmm, there's a guy I'd like to beat up before I die.	
MX83 Askeladd	
During a match, Askeladd bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep on going.	3
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?	
That doesn't change what we must do.	3
Come on, cheer up. You're not being yourself.	
Stop whining. I like it better when you're arrogant and sarcastic.	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.	
Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.	
Maybe if you increase your Strength...	3
Don't be weak.	1
MX83 Askeladd	
You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.	
If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.	3
I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.	
Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?	
That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.	3
What about just watching?	
Sure. Let's beat them all and take the prize money!	
MX83 Askeladd	
You find Askeladd lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?	
Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?	3
Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!	
Hmm, I guess you're more domestic than I thought...	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.	
They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.	
It's just a myth. Forget about it.	3
Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.	1
MX83 Askeladd	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Askeladd is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.	1
He's obviously obsessed with soccer.	-1
This is good. We can use this chance to break their back line.	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?	
If you keep it up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.	
Remember that feeling and use it when things get rough.	3
Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.	
MX83 Askeladd	
With a serious face, Askeladd is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.	
Being together is enough for me.	
A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe form falling into chaos?	-1
Well, I'm sure we'll get an answer when we get to the end of this.	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.	
It's surprising to see such advanced technology.	3
Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.	
Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.	-1
MX83 Askeladd	
Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Askeladd seems to be sick of this.	
Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Askeladd!	1
Iron Claw!	
Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)	3
MX83 Askeladd	
A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?	
I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!	-1
Don't kill him, okay?	
We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.	3
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.	
We need a decent level of personal performance.	3
What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?	
Wreck the other team.	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd is asking if you have a special person who you would like to share happy moments with. Let's give her an answer.	
I think that may be you.	
Every teammate there by my side on the field is special.	3
My Nari dakimakura! She's the best idol in the universe and is super strong.	
MX83 Askeladd	
The team is having a good run and Askeladd is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.	
Let's keep this momentum going!	-1
As long as we're not used as training material...	
There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.	3
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.	
It was an intense feeling as if I was going against the strongest team in the universe.	1
I've never dreamt about soccer.	
I've been chased by a soccerball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?	
We'll find the ones that did this and use them as fertilizers	-1
It's a big tree. It'll stand strong	
Who could've done such a hideous thing?	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd comes to you and says that she has to leave the team because of personal reasons. What should we say?	
Well, I don't want to be the one holding you back. Good luck!	
There will always be a place for you to return.	3
So, how does this work do I tap "Sell"?	
MX83 Askeladd	
You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also Askeladd's rival, has been severely injured and is in the hospital. What should you say to her?	
Sorry for the bad news. Do you want to pay a visit?	3
This is our chance to steal his precious collection.	
This wont be the end of your rival.	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.	
I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great.	1
Is there someone on the team that you like? Go propose!	
MX83 Askeladd	
You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!	
Cool! Awesome!	
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	
...Uh...So no soccer?	1
MX83 Askeladd	
The match started and Askeladd is standing still doing nothing.	
What is she doing? Is she a totem?	
Run! Just start running!	-1
Looks like we'll have to do without her.	
MX83 Askeladd	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	3
Stop right there, pig!	-1
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	
MX83 Askeladd	
Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Askeladd on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?	
You and I are already perfect. So I guess that means we shouldn't be saying our names.	
I can't just pick one...	3
I think it should be you, but will you be able to return to your normal life after all of this...Wait, I'm going off topic, right?	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd is looking excited and asks how the match went.	
The other team went home crying!	
They were a worthy opponent.	3
I led our team to victory with wedgies!	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?	
First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.	
Of course we should tell Lynbell! What are you waiting for?	
...Sometimes, the truth is better to be left a secret.	-1
MX83 Askeladd	
You're sick and in bed when Askeladd and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?	
You guys... I'm about to cry...	
I'm sorry... I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...	3
Get closer so I can spread my germs!	
MX83 Askeladd	
According to Askeladd's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.	
I want to see Tyler's true characteristics.	1
William doesn't know how to respect his seniors.	
I thought they were just friends.	
MX83 Askeladd	
Askeladd isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.	
Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.	3
Let's invest some crystals and get new players!	
We may have to go rough on the team and make them realize the problem.	
Bell	
Bell is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.	
It's surprising to see such advanced technology.	-1
Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.	3
Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.	
Bell	
Bell came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	
Let's work up a solution.	1
I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.	3
Just please go with that boring strategy.	
Bell	
You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Bell and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.	
Lets give her some space	
I could really use some grilled sweet potatoes and chestnuts	
Theres not time for tears! Find out who did this and bring justice!	-1
Bell	
Bell seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.	
The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.	1
Let's open up a bright future with this ball.	3
Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)	-1
Bell	
Bell seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.	
Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.	
Maybe if you increase your Strength...	
Don't be weak.	3
Bell	
With a serious face, Bell is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.

Bell

I want to see Tyler's true characteristics.	1
William doesn't know how to respect his seniors.	
I thought they were just friends.	3
Bell	
The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.	
Let's see what you have to say after the match.	3
I didn't know I was a talented foot volleyball player!	1
Care to receive the ball with your face?	
Bell	
Bell is looking excited and asks how the match went.	
The other team went home crying!	-1
They were a worthy opponent.	3
I led our team to victory with wedgies!	-1
Bell	
Bell suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.	
What's the agenda here? Are you trying to taint the pure angels?	-1
This is a good chance to show the baby angels how rough soccer can be!	
That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.	3
Bell	
With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Bell for solutions.	
We won't be able to win the league if we fail to overcome this.	1
I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a change.	3
How about we put the advantaged technology of Metro City to use?	-1
Bell	
You're talking to Bell about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow. Let's tell her your answer.	
I would say goodbye to all my friends.	3
If it's the end of the world, I'd pull of a crazy performance in a densely populated area before I go!	
Hmm, there's a guy I'd like to beat up before I die.	1

Cool! Awesome!	1
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	
...Uh...So no soccer?	3
Bell	
The match started and Bell is standing still doing nothing.	
What is she doing? Is she a totem?	1
Run! Just start running!	
Looks like we'll have to do without her.	3
Bell	
Bell is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.	
Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.	3
Well, having a good ace skill is a start.	
Flawless skills.	
Bell	
Bell is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?	
I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.	-1
All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.	1
I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.	3
Bell	
Bell is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	3
I feel sorry for you and ency you at the same time.	-1
Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.	1
Bell	
Bell is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.	
It's only a sport! The strongest team wins, and we are strong!	1
I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.	3
Aren't you the one everybody should be afraid of?	-1
Bell	
The team is having a good run and Bell is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.	
Let's keep this momentum going!	3
As long as we're not used as training material...	
There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.	
Bell	
Bell is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.	
I hope you get scouted by an interesting team.	
Make the scouters fall in love with your performance!	
Let's make that our goal and make it happen.	3
Bell	
The team manger ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?	
We could start a reset marathon.	1
We're going to hunt that manager down and take back our money. We will show no mercy!	
Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.	3
Bell	
You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.	
If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.	1
I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.	3
Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.	
Bell	
The match and the concert that Bell was looking for start at the same time...	
Let's hack the big screen so we can see the concert!	
Channel that sorrow and rag towards your opponents and make them pay.	-1
I'm sorry that you couldn't go.	3
Bell	
Bell won a trip around the world from a radio event!	
What about soccer? You'll have to go through me to go on that trip!	-1
Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.	3
...World? What about space? Isn't that more interesting?	1
Bell	
Bell's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?	
If you keep it up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.	1
Remember that feeling and use it when things get rough.	3
Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.	
Bell	
Bell seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.	1
I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great.	3
Is there someone on the team that you like? Go propose!	
Bell	
The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Bell to set some simple rules.	
This team is a mess. Gather everybody of the field. I'll knock that spirit back into you guys if I have to.	-1
Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.	
Come on, I'll show you the best spots around.	
Bell	
During a match, Bell bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	-1
We have to keep on going.	1
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.	3
Bell	
It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Bell and talk about what to do.	
We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.	3
I hope they have a "Continue" button around here.	-1
Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.	
Bell	
Bell wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.	
Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.	3
The character story left him a trauma.	
Maybe he just wants to duke it out.	-1
Bell	
Bell thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?	
First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.	3
Of course we should tell Lynbell! What are you waiting for?	-1
...Sometimes, the truth is better to be left a secret.	-1
Bell	
Bell is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.	
They're on cooldown.	-1
They support us from the shadows.	1
Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?	3
Bell	
Bell plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.	
I'm thinking of opening a shop.	-1
We'll see about it after the League.	
I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.	3
Bell	
You're sick and in bed when Bell and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?	
You guys... I'm about to cry...	
I'm sorry... I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...	3
Get closer so I can spread my germs!	
Bell	
Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.	
The stage is so majestic! It's awesome!	
This proves that even the aliens like Nari.	3
I think she's something more than just an idol.	
Bell	
Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?	
The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!	3
Has he gone mad?	
I guess he's happy this is a good match.	1
Bell	
Bell seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.	
They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.	
It's just a myth. Forget about it.	1
Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.	3
Bell	
MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.	
Stop right there!	-1
Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?	3
...Maybe he just likes cats!	1
Bell	
Bell isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.	
Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.	3
Let's invest some crystals and get new players!	1
We may have to go rough on the team and make them realize the problem.	-1
Bell	
This was the worst game in your entire life...Bell comes to you to cheer you up.	
Please explain why you kicked the ball into our goal post, will you?	
Thanks...I know you're the one that's the most devastated...Let's do better next time.	
Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.	3
	
Cashlove	
You come across Cashlove being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.	
Are you feeling alright?	
Don't use that ability on the field...	
Don't worry, I'll go with you.	-1
	
Chiffon	
Chiffon picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.	
So, this is how the revelation begins!	
Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...	3
Let's contact her and return this.	
Chiffon	
Chiffon is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?	
It's the place where the chosen ones learn about their destiny.	
It's the place of dreams colliding.	3
It's stressful because we can't prepare for extraterrestrial sanitation. We're completely exposed to all those unknown...things.	
Chiffon	
Chiffon is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.	
Just act like yourself. You are already the ace.	
Well, having a good ace skill is a start.	1
Flawless skills.	
Chiffon	
The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.	
I can't stand this...I need to end this quickly and go take a shower.	
What a depressing weather...	
Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!	3
Chiffon	
It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?	
I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.	
I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.	
Wow, congratulations! (claps)	3
Cynthia	
Kirin suddenly appears, pats Cynthia on the head while teasing her, and then goes away. Cynthia seems angry...	
He's like the wind. There wasn't even time to chat.	
...I think you liked it more than you thought...	
Patting you on the head? He must not fear for his life!	1
Cynthia	
A teammate that is a former member of the Dark Sisters is down sick, suffering from the aftermath of performing exorcism. Let's talk with Cynthia about what to do.	
Let's go visit her. Some fun won't do any harm. It might even cheer her up!	3
Let's leave her alone. She may find all this attention uncomfortable.	
Let's be prepared to take care of her in case her sickness gets worse.	1
Cynthia	
It's a tough match, but Cynthia is standing tall and encouraging the team. What should we say to her?	
You really help us a lot in these situations.	
You're a good person.	
Your spirit is an inspiration to us all.	3
Cynthia	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Cynthia asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel like I can fly" or something?	3
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	
Cynthia	
Cynthia was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.	
Oh, that'll be so cute!	-1
It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all gown up...Make 'em into a good meal!	3
We can play soccer with the penguins!	-1
Cynthia	
Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Cynthia is curious and wants to take a look.	
We should probably ignore them and just walk by.	3
Let's go help them!	-1
They must love volunteer work!	-1
Cynthia	
Cynthia seems to be interested in the Micrinum from Kiri, which is said to be good for beauty and anti-aging. Let's talk to her.	
I think that's a good choice.	
Looks aren't important when it comes to soccer.	
You're young and good looking even without that.	3
Cynthia	
The team is at Metro City. Cynthia seems to be surprised how the people of Metro City have mechanical bodies.	
I like how they don't mind physical flaws.	
I like how even the minority can be saved in this society.	
You have a heart of gold.	3
Cynthia	
Cynthia is furious about how Lucian is always surrounded by girls. What should we say?	
Are you jealous?	3
He's popular, just not as much as me.	
He's good looking and has a good personality. Maybe that's why.	
Cynthia	
Cynthia suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.	-1
How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.	3
Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!	-1
Cynthia	
Cynthia is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.	
The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.	3
I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals.	-1
I am so thankful to them.	
Cynthia	
Cynthia looks disappointed about the size of the Galaxy League. What would be an appropriate response?	
Nervous? Trust me. I got you.	3
What were you expecting? An intergalactic war?	-1
Isn't it awesome to see the galaxy come together for soccer?	
Cynthia	
A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Cynthia.	
I feel like he's mocking us!	1
It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.	
He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.	
Cynthia	
Cynthia falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?	
If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.	
Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!	-1
Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.	-1
Cynthia	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	3
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	
Cynthia	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Cynthia having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match.	-1
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?	
...I see two idiots standing in front of me...	3
Cynthia	
Cynthia lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?	
Well, this could have been prevented if you just consumes those Swirlies like I told you...	3
I will avenge you!	
Cynthia	
The team seems very nervous facing Skalardra. What should we do?	
Hmm? What's wrong everybody?	
Political power means nothing on the field.	
Huh? I think Cynthia is prettier.	3
Cynthia	
Cynthia is interested in Selena and is asking for your opinion. What should we say?	
She's kind and sweet. Maybe you'll have a shot?	
Be honest and show a sincere attitude.	3
Considering your personality, I think she'll accept you.	
Cynthia	
Cynthia is asking you what you think is it that makes this team great. You weren't expecting this, but you should give her an answer.	
We have a strong lineup of players that make our star players shine brighter.	
Well, you're looking at the one person that is making this team great.	
You. I know you're doing much for the team without taking any credit.	3
Cynthia	
Cynthia scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!	
Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?	
That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!	3
You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!	
Cynthia	
Cynthia seems to be uncomfortable to hear about the love life of other teammates. Let's talk to her.	
It's all good as long as it doesn't affect the match.	1
Should we join the club?	3
Just say it. You're jealous.	1
Cynthia	
Cynthia has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.	
You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.	3
Your attacks are so strong the opponent can't handle it. You should keep that going.	
I hope you're sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.	
Cynthia	
Cynthia wants to have an academic conversation about the 5th dimension, string theory, and other infamously hard space theories. Why...?	
(She wants you to be a good listener.)	1
(There must be a reason why she started this conversation.)	1
(Maybe she brought snacks but is too shy to share it with me.)	3
Cynthia	
Cynthia is talking about how famous her rivals are in the Galaxy League. She seems jealous. Let's talk to her.	
You're as good as they are, I'd say you deservee more credit.	1
Good rivalry brings both sides to higher levels.	1
I'll be your rival from now.	
Cynthia	
Cynthia seems to be determined to crush the opposing team. Let's give her some advice.	
That's the spirit! Let teach them a lesson!	3
With your skills and dedication, I have no doubt that you will.	1
I like how you're doing your best.	
Cynthia	
Cynthia looks sad because she feels her friendship with a friend in a rival team is falling apart. What should we say to her?	
It's not your fault. Let's try to find out why this is happening.	
Try starting off with some small talk.	3
If your friend is truly your friend, she will understand.	
Cynthia	
Cynthia is spreading the happy news about her cousin having a baby. Let's congratulate her.	
Congratulation!	
So, the numerous baby clothes you've been making were all for this day ?	3
I hope that baby comes to be a great soccer player, just like you.	-1
Cynthia	
The team will not have a match for some time. Cynthia asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.	
Hmm, wanna go shopping?	
I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.	3
Cynthia	
Kuma is furiously chasing Ogre. Cynthia seems confused.	
Two bears...Which one is Kuma?	
Well, one thing is for sure. One of them did something stupid.	1
Looks like Orge is goofing around. I mean the guy has like over 200 pounds over Kuma.	
	
Freyja	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Freyja some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	-1
Make him know who he's up against	-1
Let's try out some forward passes	3
Freyja	
It's a very intense match and Freyja falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Freyja up and the two exchange smiles.	
Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?	
True sportsmanship! Wonderful!	
That player must have a heart of gold! 	3
Freyja	
As Freyja said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	3
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	-1
Freyja	
Freyja falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?	
If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.	
Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!	
Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.	3
Freyja	
Freyja scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!	
Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?	
That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!	-1
You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!	
Freyja	
Freyja is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with Freyja.	
I think we should come up with an action speed deck or go for counter attacks...	
I'll try to have the ball come your way	1
We can overcome this with team effort.	-1
Freyja	
Freyja doesn't like the new team advertisement video.	
There's not enough fan service.	
It didn't portray your awesome performance.	1
It didn't have to have the bench warmers in the video.	
Freyja	
It's Freyja's birthday. Let's give her a present.	
Here! I made some cookies with the team.	1
I stole this treasure box from Kuma.	
This is a championship trophy replica for you. The designs are inspired by you.	1
Freyja	
Freyja is worried that she has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous things. What should we tell her?	
Look at the beautiful players! This is paradise!	
You're the most dangerous of them all.	1
Makes it worth the challenge, don't you think so?	-1
Freyja	
You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also Freyja's rival, has been severely injured and is in the hospital. What should you say to her?	
Sorry for the bad news. Do you want to pay a visit?	-1
This is our chance to steal his precious collection.	
This wont be the end of your rival.	-1
Freyja	
Freyja is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.	
It's all thanks to you.	1
It's a result of team effort.	
The opponents are mesmerized by the beauty of our players.	
Freyja	
Freyja is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?	
We'll find the ones who did this and use them as fertilizers.	-1
It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.	
Who could have done such a hideous thing?	
Freyja	
Freyja says she wants to cry because the goal keeper on the other team just won't go down no matter how many shots she makes.	
Let's start by picking ther defense apart.	
Let's come up with a new strategy to give you more synergy.	
I'll come up with a formation that can bring the best out of everybody.	-1
Freyja	
Freyja brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...	
Throw it away. NOW.	-1
Drink it up!	
Freyja	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Freyja asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel like I can fly" or something?	
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	1
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	
Freyja	
Freyja wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?	
That seems like a dangerous idea... Let's not make any quick decisions.	
What about just watching?	
Sure. Let's beat them all and take the prize money!	-1
Freyja	
Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Freyja seems to be sick of this.	
Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Freyja!	
Iron Claw!	
Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)	3
Freyja	
Freyja is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to her.	
I want you to form a team and catch every single bear near this locker room.	
...If you want to say something, it's alright. I'll be listening.	3
Let's go tell the manager.	-1
Freyja	
Freyja is asking if you have a special person who you would like to share happy moments with. Let's give her an answer.	
I think that may be you.	
Every teammate there by my side on the field is special.	-1
My Nari dakimakura! She's the best idol in the universe and is super strong.	
Freyja	
A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?	
I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!	
Don't kill him, okay?	-1
We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.	
Freyja	
Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Freyja on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?	
You and I are already perfect. So I guess that means we shouldn't be saying our names.	
I can't just pick one...	-1
I think it should be you, but will you be able to return to your normal life after all of this...Wait, I'm going off topic, right?	3
Freyja	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	-1
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	
Freyja	
Freyja was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.	
Oh, that'll be so cute!	
It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!	
We can play soccer with the penguins!	1
Freyja	
Freyja is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.	
The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.	
I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals.	1
I am so thankful to them.	
Freyja	
You find Freyja being very excited after performing an awesome play. How will you react?	
Can't you do that more often?! (Cries)	3
Nice play! Fantastic!	
Now we're starting to look like a team!	
	
Guinevere	
Guinevere is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?	
You can overcome this like always. Right?	3
It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.	
Let's solve the problem one by one.	1
Guinevere	
Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Guinevere is curious and wants to take a look.	
We should probably ignore them and just walk by.	
Let's go help them!	3
They must love volunteer work!	
Guinevere	
Guinevere lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?	
Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...	
I will avenge you!	3
Guinevere	
As Guinevere said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	3
Guinevere	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	3
Guinevere	
The crowd is cheering for Guinevere. Guinevere seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.	
They're all in love with your enthusiastic play.	3
They now you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.	1
How about just acceptng the compliments for today?	
Guinevere	
Guinevere was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.	
Oh, that'll be so cute!	
It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!	1
We can play soccer with the penguins!	
	
EA43 Haru	
Ogre's pony tail slapped Haru in the face!	
Even his hair is a weapon! Is that even allowed?	-1
That must hurt.	
Ugh...Gross...	
EA43 Haru	
Haru says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to him?	
That's unacceptable!	
You can only find your true potential when you don't rely on your skills!	-1
Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.	
EA43 Haru	
Haru was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin himself. Let's talk to him.	
Oh, that'll be so cute!	-1
It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up... Make 'em into a good meal!	
We can play soccer with the penguins!	
	
Lynia	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	3
Stop right there, pig!	
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	
Lynia	
Lynia came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.	
What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?	-1
I'm sure you got scammed.	-1
I hope that wasn't all you got.	3
Lynia	
It seems that Lynia is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?	
Listen carefully and you'll find her.	
Let's ask Khirel to find her...	
Lynia? Nah, she never gets lost.	3
Lynia	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Lynia some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	-1
Make him know who he's up against.	-1
Let's try out some forward passes.	3
Lynia	
Lynia is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.	
I'm afraid to be honest.	
I was always looking forward for that moment.	3
Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes, will you?	
Lynia	
You're watching the storm with Lynia and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.	
Is something troubling her? I'm having a bad feeling.	-1
What's wrong with her?	3
She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!	-1
Lynia	
Lynia looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.	
It's space. Anything can exists here.	3
How about we ask Jeunese?	1
Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.	
Lynia	
A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?	
I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!	
Don't kill him, okay?	
We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.	3
Lynia	
The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?	
Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.	
We didn't play dirty, right?	
They will never learn with an attitude like that.	3
Lynia	
The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Lynia to set some simple rules.	
This team is a mess. Gather everybody on the field. I'll knock that spirit back into you guys if I have to.	-1
Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.	3
Come on, I'll show you the best spots around!	
Lynia	
Latios is chatting with Lynia after the match. Let's barge in.	
Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's our pretty girl.	-1
Lynia was fantastic on the field, right?	1
I'm looking foward to our next match!	3
Lynia	
The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Lynia and her opponent isn't over yet.	
You better win that fight!	3
Hey! The match is over!	1
I've never seen her worked up that much.	
Lynia	
Lynia is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.	
We need a decent level of personal performance.	3
What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?	
Wreck the other team.	1
Lynia	
You come across Lynia being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.	
Are you feeling alright?	3
Don't use that ability on the field...	-1
Don't worry, I'll go with you.	-1
Lynia	
Lynia says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.	
I think you two have something in common...	-1
Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.	
Hmm? That is odd...What do you think about this?	1
Lynia	
Lynia announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.	
You'll have to compete with me!	
I feel bad for the players that have to face you.	
I have faith in you.	3
Lynia	
Lynia is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.	
Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes. You're a precious part of this team.	
Don't be anxious. Have faith and keep following me.	
That's why I need your help.	3
Lynia	
Lynia, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.	
It was an intense feeling as if I was going against the strongest team in the universe.	1
I've never dreamt about soccer.	3
I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.	
Lynia	
You find Lynia lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?	
Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner ?	3
Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!	
Hmm, I guess you're more domestic than I thought.	
Lynia	
Lynia looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.	
Did you prepare the meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.	
Don't worry. Leave it up to me.	
Littre will be fine.	3
Lynia	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	
Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.	
Let's give them a hand.	3
Lynia	
You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.	
Can't you cook ramen by yourself?	3
Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.	-1
Is Marilyn your mother or nanny?	
Lynia	
Lynia seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.	
It's thanks to you! Thanks for listening to my instructions.	
I'm starting to see true strength in this team.	3
Perfect! No mistakes made!	-1
Lynia	
James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.	
...We should get out of here.	3
...It's about to go down...! Where's the popcorn?	
James and Bora...Who's the villain?	
Lynia	
Lynia is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?	
You can overcome this like always. Right?	3
It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.	
Let's solve the problems one by one.	
Lynia	
Lynia caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?	
I think we should hang him.	
Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.	3
You came to see my marvelous moves? I'm flattered.	-1
Lynia	
Lynia is angry because she was criticized by her performance and is asking your opinion. Let's give her an answer.	
I want to practice with you, if that's okay with you. No?	
I admit it. You're the best in the team.	1
I'm sure the lesson here is that all of us need to learn.	
Lynia	
You come across Lynia who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?	
I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.	
Trust me and your teammates. Sit this one out.	
Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.	3
Lynia	
Lynia wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.	
I'm surprised you care so much for your friends.	
Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.	3
It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.	-1
Lynia	
Lynia's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Lynia seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.	
That player is just messing with you.	
I think that player likes you.	
You're doing fine. Don't play you opponents's game.	1
Lynia	
The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Lynia do?	
(Give her instructions so that she can do her share of the cleaning quickly.)	
(Let her take some of the team memebers and allow them to clean freely.)	3
(Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.)	
Lynia	
You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Lynia seems to be worried.	
Weakling. Should've been rougher on that player.	
It's unfortunate, but that happened during a match and it's not our fault.	3
Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.	
	
Luka	
Luka's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Luka seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.	
That player is just messing with you.	
I think that player likes you.	
You're doing fine. Don't play you opponents's game.	-1
Luka	
The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Luka do?	
(Give her instructions so that she can do her share of the cleaning quickly.)	1
(Let her take some of the team memebers and allow them to clean freely.)	-1
(Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.)	3
Luka	
Luka wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.	
I'm surprised you care so much for your friends.	
Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.	
It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.	3
Luka	
Luka came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.	
What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?	3
I'm sure you got scammed.	
I hope that wasn't all you got.	
Luka	
You're watching the storm with Luka and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.	
Is something troubling her? I'm having a bad feeling.	1
What's wrong with her?	-1
She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!	3
Luka	
Luka wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?	
That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.	
What about just watching?	3
Sure. Let's beat them all and take the prize money.	
Luka	
Latios is chatting with Luka after the match. Let's barge in.	
Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's out pretty girl.	3
Luka was fantastic on the field, right?	1
I'm looking forward to our next match!	
Luka	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	1
Stop right there, pig!	3
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	
Luka	
Luka seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.	
It's thanks to you! Thanks for listening to my instructions.	-1
I'm starting to see true strength in this team.	1
Perfect! No mistakes made!	3
Luka	
It seems that Luka is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?	
Listen carefully and you'll find her.	3
Let's ask Khirel to find her...	
Luka? Nah, she never gets lost.	
Luka	
Luka is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?	
We'll find the ones that did this and use them as fertilizers.	
It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.	1
Who could've done such a hideous thing?	3
Luka	
You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Luka seems to be worried.	
Weakling. Should've been rougher on that player.	
It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.	1
Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.	3

Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.	1
Hmm? That is odd...What do you think about this?	3
Luka	
Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Luka.	
I think he felt better because of the positive energy you always have around you.	1
Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?	
You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.	3
Luka	
Luka is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.	
Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes. You're a precious part of this team.	3
Don't be anxious. Have faith and keep following me.	1
That's why I need your help.	-1
Luka	
Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Luka seems to be sick of this.	
Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Luka!	3
Iron Claw!	
Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)	
Luka	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	3
Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.	1
Let's give them a hand.	-1

You better win that fight!	-1
Hey! The match is over!	3
I've never seen her worked up that much.	
Luka	
Luka is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?	
That doesn't change what we must do.	
Come on, cheer up. You're not being yourself.	3
Stop whining, I like it better when you're arrogant and sarcastic.	
Luka	
Luka is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?	
Don't worry about me! Do your job!	1
Can you peel this guy off of me?	
Don't come over here! It's dangerous!	
Luka	
The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?	
Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.	3
We didn't play dirty, right?	
They will never learn with an attitude like that.

We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.	1
Luka	
You find Luka depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.	
Don't mind it. It's our fault. We weren't able to make use of your strength.	
You did well and I think you for that.	1
It's not your fault that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!	
Luka	
Luka announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.	
You'll have to compete with me!	3

You came to see my marvelous moves? I'm flattered.	3
Luka	
Luka is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.	
I'll sleep by your side tonight.	3
I see. We must be careful. I'll be watching over you.	
It's just a dream. Forget about it.	1
Luka	
Luka looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.	
Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.	
Don't worry. Leave it up to me.	1
Littre will be fine.	
	
MX82 Vann	
Vann is asking for special training sessions because he's not satisfied with today's performance. What should we tell him?	
Good. I'll train you until you can't stand up.	-1
If that's your wish.	
Sure, Let's get onto it.	
MX82 Vann	
It suddenly began to rain heavily. You see Vann running up ahead.	
(Catch up and share your umbrella.)	3
(Let him steal your umbrella.)	
(Run past him and smile.)	
MX82 Vann	
Vann is thinking about what Selena said about saving the galaxy if we win the Galaxy League.	
Then we should do our very best to win.	3
I can play along if there's something in it for me.	
It's not good to believe what others say.	
MX82 Vann	
You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.	
How can I earn gold? Where do I have to go to find the REAL Underground?	
It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.	
So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.	3
MX82 Vann	
Vann blushes up and tells you that he's happy he can play soccer with you. What should we tell him?	
Me too. You're a great leader.	3
*Smiles bitterly*	
Hmm, I'll prepare a rougher match.	
MX82 Vann	
Vann is furious about the referee that's clearly favoring the other team. Should we stop him?	
(Step on the referee's foot and pretend it was an accident.)	
The tougher it gets, the better it feels to win. Right?	1
Ignore the referee. Focus on the match.	3
MX82 Vann	
Vann did his best, but he failed to achieve the results he wanted and looks sad. We should say something to him.	
Sorry, I feel that this is on me.	
That wasn't enough! You have to try harder!	-1
It's experiences like this that bonds us together.	
MX82 Vann	
Vann looks excited as he's talking with the team about pets. He turns around and asks you what kind of pet you like.	
I think that a baby duck following its mother is one of the most adorable things to watch.	3
I like puppies. The loyal ones!	1
I like cats. I like the egoistic side of them.	
MX82 Vann	
You come across Vann, who was overwhelmed by his opponent throughout the game. Let's cheer him up.	
Those scumbags played dirty. Ugh, I'm angry!	
I should step on that player's foot next time.	
I'm proud that you played your game and didn't descend to the opponent's level.	1
MX82 Vann	
You witnessed a player on the other side putting a tack in Vann's shoe.	
(Ignore it.)	
(Remove the tack and tell the manager on the other team.)	3
(Tell Vann who did this.)	
MX82 Vann	
Vann continues to charge into the opponent's defense line and keeps failing. What should we do?	
(Makes a strategic desicion.)	3
(Guide him by kicking the ball toward the weak link in the opponent's defense.)	
(He looks happy. Let's let him be.)	
MX82 Vann	
Vann is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''	
Not again.	
Let's do this! I'm at your disposal!	1
I like what you said.	3
MX82 Vann	
Vann, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal what your agenda really is. What should we say?	
To become stongest being in space! I shall tramp on everything that stands in my path!	
Just playing soccer, that's all.	
To bring justice with soccer. That's all.	3
MX82 Vann	
It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking up for the morning training. What should we tell Vann to do?	
They all need scolding.	3
Wake them up. Kick them if you need to.	
(Step on everyone that's still sleeping.)	
MX82 Vann	
Mortor and Wizol of the Peacemakers are helping an old man. Vann seems to be surprised.	
Well, what do you know! They have some decency in them after all.	3
Hmmm.	
It's good to know they're not shallow people.	
MX82 Vann	
Vann is thinking about what the Universe of Oblivion is.	
Don't be scared about such petty things.	1
I don't like the word oblivion.	
I don't care as long as it doesn't harm me.	
MX82 Vann	
Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Vann is asking how he did in the match.	
You were picking the other team apart! It was awesome!	
It was pretty sary watching you so pleased with the rough plays of the opponents.	
You bring the best out of the team. Good work!	3
MX82 Vann	
Cracsus threatens to hack Vann's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?	
Let's blackmail Robin that we'll pluck out all his plants.	
I contacted Hildegard.	
Don't fall for this cheap shot.	3
MX82 Vann	
Vann feels his heart races when he sees Littre.	
...Do you want to spend the rest of your life being with an abusive herbivore like alien creature?	
...Do you want a Superb Power-up?	3
...That's not a rabbit.	
MX82 Vann	
Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?	
We will confront them fair and square, and win.	
I'll go blow up their lodging.	
Pathetic. We'll show them that we're better in many ways.	-1
MX82 Vann	
You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?	
I feel sorry, but that's irrelevant to the match.	
This is going to be a cake walk.	
I'm considering making an anonymous donation.	1
	
Altair	
With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Altair for solutions.	
We won't be able to win the league if we fail to overcome this.	
I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a change.	
How about we put the advantaged technology of Metro City to use?	-1
	
EA82 Nikita	
A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Nikita.	
I feel like he's mocking us!	
It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.	
He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.	3
EA82 Nikita	
This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?	
Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.	1
I heard that the bath products on Earth are the best in the universe.	
I'm going to check out the new comic issues. Wanna come along?	
EA82 Nikita	
The crowd is cheering for Nikita. Nikita seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.	
They're all in love with your enthusiastic play.	
They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.	-1
How about just accepting the compliments for today?	3
EA82 Nikita	
As Nikita said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	-1
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	3
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	1
EA82 Nikita	
Nikita thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.	
That's because you haven't opened up your "third eye"!	
Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?	1
Hmm, her tail is a bit weird and her ears are definitely human...	3
EA82 Nikita	
Ogre's pony tail slapped Nikita in the face!	
Even his hair is a weapon! Is that allowed?	
That must hurt.	1
Ugh...Gross...	
EA82 Nikita	
Nikita suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.	-1
How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.	
Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!	-1
EA82 Nikita	
You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.	
...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...	3
Ugh...I want to dig my eyes out.	
Fontus...You sure are my archnemesis!	-1
EA82 Nikita	
It's a very intense match and Nikita falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Nikita up and the two exchange smiles.	
Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?	
True sportsmanship! Wonderful!	-1
That player must have a heart of gold.	-1
EA82 Nikita	
Nikita is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.	
Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.	-1
It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy! This is nonsense.	
We haven't awakened our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyond!	
EA82 Nikita	
It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?	
I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.	
I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.	-1
Wow, congratulations! (Claps)	
EA82 Nikita	
Nikita was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.	
Oh, that'll be so cute!	-1
It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!	3
We can play soccer with the penguins!	
EA82 Nikita	
Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.	
Well, now what?	
Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?	-1
A crow?!	1
EA82 Nikita	
Nikita is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.	
Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!	1
You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.	3
I knew this day would come.	
EA82 Nikita	
Nikita says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.	
Hmm, a revived person that forgot his purpose...Reminds me of somebody.	
He'll remember someday.	
That's bad. I'm sure it's something important!	3
EA82 Nikita	
Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Nikita is curious and wants to take a look.	
We should probably ignore them and just walk by.	3
Let's go help them!	-1
They must love volunteer work!	
EA82 Nikita	
This was the worst game in your entire life...Nikita comes to you to cheer you up.	
Please explain why you kicked the ball into our goal post, will you?	
Thanks...I know you're the one that's the most devastated...Let's do better next time.	1
Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.	
EA82 Nikita	
Nikita is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?	
It's the place where the chosen ones learn about their destiny.	
It's the place of dreams colliding.	
It's stressful because we can't prepare for extraterrestrial sanitation. We're completly exposed to all those unknown... things.	3
EA82 Nikita	
Nikita seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?	
I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.	
The eyepatch...I wonder if she washes it. She seems to have it on all the times.	3
That's a dangerous secret you're trying to find out about. Do you still want to know?	
EA82 Nikita	
Nikita wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?	
Perfect planning and perfect execution	3
All goes as planned...hmm? Just ignore that.	-1
Why don't you join them and find out?	
EA82 Nikita	
Nikita is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.	
Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!	1
Life, eh? I guess that's a bit too serious for me, but I think I understand how you feel.	
And that's how we walk towards our destiny.	
EA82 Nikita	
Nikita has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.	
You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.	3
Your attacks are so strong the opponent can't handle it. You should keep that going.	
I hope you're sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.	
EA82 Nikita	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	-1
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	
EA82 Nikita	
Nikita is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.	
I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.	3
The fans love your performance!	-1
Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.	
EA82 Nikita	
Nikita is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.	
This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!	1
Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!	1
How about some presents for your parents?	
EA82 Nikita	
Nikita falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?	
If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.	
Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!	
Well, let's stsart by dropping that player's HP to 1.	-1
	
Nerua	
The match started and Nerua is standing still doing nothing.	
What is she doing? Is she a totem?	1
Run! Just start running!	
Looks like we'll have to do without her.	3
Nerua	
Nerua won a trip around the world from a radio event!	
What about soccer? You'll have to go through me to go on that trip	-1
Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.	3
...World? What about space? Isn't that more interesting?	
Nerua	
The team will not have a match for some time. Nerua asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.	-1
Hmm, wanna go shopping?	
I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.	
Nerua	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Nerua asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel like I can fly" or something?	
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	3
Nerua	
The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.	
Let's see what you have to say after the match.	3
I didn't know I was a talented foot volleyball player!	
Care to receive the ball with your face?	
Nerua	
Nerua has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.	
You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.	-1
Your attacks are so strong the opponent can't handle it. You should keep that going.	-1
I hope you're sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.	3
Nerua	
Nerua is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.	
(Put your thumbs up, win, and send a jucy smile.)	
(Pat her on the head.)	3
(Just nod your head.)	1
Nerua	
Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.	
The stage is so majestic! It's awesome!	-1
This proves that even the aliens like Nari.	
I think she's something more than just an idol.	
Nerua	
Nerua is looking excited and asks how the match went.	
The other team went home crying!	
They were a worthy opponent.	3
I led our team to victory with wedgies!	
Nerua	
Nerua wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.	
Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.	
The character story left him a trauma.	1
Maybe he just wants to duke it out.	
Nerua	
Nerua isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.	
Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.	3
Let's invest some crystals and get new players!	
We may have to go rough on the team and make them realize the problem.	
Nerua	
MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.	
Stop right there!	
Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?	3
...Maybe he just likes cats!	
Nerua	
With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Nerua for solutions.	
We won't be able to win the league if we fail to overcome this.	
I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.	3
How about we put that advanced technology of Metro City to use?	
Nerua	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	-1
Nerua	
This was the worst game in your entire life...Nerua comes to you to cheer you up.	
Please explain why you kicked the ball into our goal post, will you?	-1
Thanks...I know you're the one that's the most devastated...Let's do better next time.	
Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.	3
Nerua	
Nerua is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.	
The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.	
I feel like whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!	
I am so thankful to then.	3
Nerua	
As Nerua said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	3
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	
Nerua	
Nerua is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.	
It's only a sport! The strongest team wins, and we are strong!	
I'm sure everybody's feeling the same way you feel.	3
Aren't you the one everybody should be afraid of?	
Nerua	
The team manger ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?	
We could start a reset marathon.	
We're going to hunt that manager down and take back our money. We will show no mercy!	
Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.	3
Nerua	
Nerua suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.	
What's the agenda here? Are you trying to taint the pure angels?	
This is a good chance to show the baby angels how rough soccer can be!	
That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.	3
Nerua	
You're sick and in bed when Nerua and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?	
You guys... I'm about to cry...	
I'm sorry... I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...	3
Get closer so I can spread my germs!	
Nerua	
Nerua is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.	
I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.	
The fans love your performance!	1
Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.	
Nerua	
Nerua brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...	
Throw it away. NOW.	-1
Drink it up!	
	
Veronica	
Veronica is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to her.	
I want you to form a team and catch every single bear near this locker room.	1
...If you want to say something, it's alright. I'll be listening.	-1
Let's go tell the manager.	3
Veronica	
Ogre's pony tail slapped Veronica in the face!	
Even his hair is a weapon! Is that allowed?	
That must hurt.	3
Ugh...Gross...	1
Veronica	
It's Veronica's birthday. Let's give her a present.	
Here! I made some cookies with the team.	1
I stole this treasure box from Kuma.	
This is a championship trophy replica for you. The designs are inspired by you. 	
Veronica	
Veronica is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.	
Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.	3
It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy! This is nonsense!	
We haven't awakend our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyond!	-1
Veronica	
Veronica comes to you and says that she has to leave the team because of personal reasons. What should we say?	
Well, I don't want to be the one holding you back. Good Luck!	3
There will always be a place for you to return.	1
So, how does this work? Do I tap "Sell"?	-1
Veronica	
Veronica says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?	
That's unacceptable!	
You can only find your true potential when you don't rely on your skills!	
Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.	3
Veronica	
Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Veronica on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?	
You and I are already perfect. So I guess that means we shouldn't be saying our names.	3
I can't just pick one...	1
I think it should be you, but will you be able to return to your normal life after all of this...Wait, I'm going off topic, right?	-1
Veronica	
The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?	
Manga, anime, and figures...! Here I come!	-1
It's time for some good food.	3
I guess I can go to the soccer gear shop.	1
Veronica	
Veronica seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?	
I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.	-1
The eyepatch...I wonder if she washes it. She seems to have it on all the times.	1
That's a dangerous secret you're trying to find out about. Do you still want to know?	-1
Veronica	
The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.	
I can't stand this...I need to end this quickly and go take a shower.	1
What a depressing weather...	
Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!	
Veronica	
You got a couple of tickets to Veronica's live concert. Veronica seems to be interested.	
These are for you, of course. Here.	3
We're going to make it fair and gather everybody around so we can draw for the ticket.	
I'll give you this, so get rid of that fake ticket.	
Veronica	
Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.	
Well, now what?	
Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?	
A crow?!	3
Veronica	
Veronica is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.	
He's just material for leveling up.	3
I like how all of the Gate Keepers have different characteristics.	
That bear...Is a hero...!	
Veronica	
Veronica is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.	
I'm sure there were multiple reasons on why the kingdom fell. It's sad to hear such stories.	
So, is that king entering the Galaxy League?	-1
Pathetic... That is no king.	
Veronica	
Veronica is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.	
This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!	1
Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!	
How about some presents for your parents?	
Veronica	
Veronica says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.	
Hmm, a revivded person that forgot his purpose... Reminds me of somebody.	-1
He'll remember someday.	3
That's bad. I'm sure it's something important!	
Veronica	
Veronica doesn't like the new team advertisement video.	
There's not enough fan service.	
It didn't portray your awesome performance.	3
It didn't have to have the bench warmers in the video.	
Veronica	
This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?	
Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.	
I heard that the bath products on Earth are the best in the universe.	1
I'm going to check out the new comic issues. Wanna come along?	
Veronica	
Veronica is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.	
It's all thanks to you.	
It's a result of team effort.	-1
The opponents are mesmerized by the beauty of our players.	1
Veronica	
Veronica is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.	
It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.	3
Do I have to stop the match?	
It's time, Veronica! Awaken the 6th attribute and show your true powers!	-1
Veronica	
Veronica is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.	
Yeah. I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!	
Life, eh? I guess that's a bit too serious for me, but I think I understand how you feel.	1
And that's how we walk towards our destiny.	
Veronica	
Veronica is asking if you have a special person who you would like to share happy moments with. Let's give her an answer.	
I think that may be you.	3
Every teammate there by my side on the field is special.	1
My Nari dakimakura! She's the best idol in the universe and is super strong.	
Veronica	
Veronica is worried that she has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous things. What should we tell her?	
Look at the beautiful players! This is paradise!	1
You're the most dangerous of them all.	
Makes it worth the challenge, don't you think so?	
Veronica	
Veronica wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?	
Perfect planning and perfect execution	1
All goes as planned...hmm? Just ignore that.	
Why don't you join them and find out?	
	
Jury	
Jury is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?	
I don't think you need to worry about a diet.	1
You're playing soccer! You're fine!	1
Please don't forget about the match.	
Jury	
It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?	
I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.	
I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.	
Wow, congratulations! (Claps)	3
Jury	
The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.	
I can't stand this...I need to end this quicklly and go take a shower.	
What a depressing weather...	
Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!	3
Jury	
Jury is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.	
Yeah. I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!	
Life, eh? I guess that's a bit too serious for me, but I think I understand how you feel.	1
And that's how we walk towards our destiny.	
Jury	
Jury is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle.	
You seem like the princess...Scratch that, the queen.	
She seems like a nice girl.	
It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.	3
Jury	
Jury is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.	
This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!	
Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!	3
How about some presents for your parents?	1
Jury	
Jury says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.	
Hmm, a revived person that forgot his purpose...Reminds me of somebody.	-1
He'll remember someday.	
That's bad. I'm sure it's something important!	
Jury	
Jury is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.	
Life is a light of its own.	-1
That's deep. I think it's cool.	
How about we make it to the top of the Galaxy League and shine the universe with the light within us?	1
Jury	
Jury went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?	
We should think about how to make fun of her when she comes back.	
I feel sorry for the other team.	
Jury is in danger! We have to save her!	-1
Jury	
Jury thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.	
That's because you haven't opened up your "third eye"!	-1
Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?	
Hmm, her tail is a bit weird and her ears are definitely human...	1
Jury	
Jury is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.	
Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!	3
You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.	
I knew this day would come.	-1
Jury	
You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Jury hands you a present.	
(A cute and pretty pendant)	1
(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)	
(A choker with a pretty radical design.)	
Jury	
Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Jury seems to be troubled. What should we do?	
If you guys keep giving Jury trouble, I swear to god I'll use you both as special training material.	1
If you had to choose on of the two, which would it be?	
You both need to be disciplined by Jury.	
Jury	
Jury seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?	
I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.	
The eyepatch...I wonder if she washes it. She seems to have it on at all times.	1
That'sa  dangerous secret you're trying to find out about. Do you still want to know?	
Jury	
Jury is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.	
Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.	3
It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy! This is nonsense!	
We haven't awakend our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyond!	-1
Jury	
Jury is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.	
My teammates and their flawless play!	1
My friends from previous life...They would be pleased to see me win.	
My fans!	
Jury	
Jury wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?	
Perfect planning and perfect execution	
All goes as planned...hmm? Just ignore that.	-1
Why don't you join them and find out?	
Jury	
Ogre's pony tail slapped Jury in the face!	
Even his hair is a weapon! Is that even allowed?	-1
That must hurt.	
Ugh...Gross...	1
Jury	
Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.	
Well, now what?	
Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?	
A crow?!	3
Jury	
Jury says she's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.	
Is her name really Kiki?	
Ask her if she likes you and if she wants to join our team.	-1
Tell her to be our lap cat.	
Jury	
Jury says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?	
That's unacceptable!	
You can only find your true potential when you don't rely on your skills!	
Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.	3
Jury	
You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.	
...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...	3
Ugh...I want to dig my eyes out.	
Fontus...You sure are my archnemesis!	
	
Leventor	
You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Leventor seems to be worried.	
Weakling. Should've been rougher on that player.	-1
It's unfortunate, but that happened during a match and it's not our fault.	3
Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.	
Leventor	
A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?	
I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!	-1
Don't kill him, okay?	
We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.	
Leventor	
Leventor is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to him?	
That doesn't change what we must do.	
Come on, cheer up. You're not being yourself.	
Stop whining. I like it better when you're arrogant and sarcastic.	-1
Leventor	
Leventor is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.	
It's surprising to see such advanced technology.	3
Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.	1
Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.	-1
Leventor	
Leventor came to you after the match, and says he's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	
Let's work up a solution.	
I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.	-1
Just please go with that boring strategy.	
Leventor	
The team is having a good run and Leventor is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.	
Let's keep this momentum going!	-1
As long as we're not used as training material...	
There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.	3
Leventor	
You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!	
Cool! Awesome!	
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	3
...Uh...So no soccer?	
Leventor	
Leventor came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.	
What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?	
I'm sure you got scammed.	
I hope that wasn't all you got.	3
Leventor	
Leventor seems to be lost after having a good match while his fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to him.	
They say fortune-telling inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.	
It's just a mayth. Forget about it.	3
Game result aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.	1
Leventor	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Leventor is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.	1
He's obviously obsessed with soccer.	
This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.	3
Leventor	
You find Leventor lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?	
Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?	3
Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!	
Hmm, I guess you're more domestic than I thought.	
Leventor	
Leventor wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?	
That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.	3
What about just watching?	
Sure. Let's beat them all and take the prize money.	-1
Leventor	
Leventor wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. He wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to him.	
I'm surprised you care so much for your friends.	
Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.	3
It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.	
Leventor	
Leventor is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.	
They're on cooldown.	
They support us from the shadows.	3
Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?	
Leventor	
Leventor is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.	
Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.	
Well, having a good ace skill is a start.	
Flawless skills.	3
Leventor	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Leventor some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	-1
Make him know who he's up against	-1
Let's try out some forward passes.	3
Leventor	
Leventor is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give him an answer.	
We need a decent level of personal performance.	3
What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?	
Wreck the other team.	
Leventor	
Leventor seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.	
Let's make armor out of spirit stones.	-1
Maybe if you increase your Strength...	3
Don't be weak.	1
Leventor	
During a match, Leventor bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep on going.	3
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.	1
Leventor	
James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.	
...We should get out of here.	3
...It's about to go down...! Where's the popcorn?	-1
James and Bora...Who's the villain?	
Leventor	
Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?	
The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!	1
Has he gone mad?	
I guess he's happy this is a good match.	3
Leventor	
The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Leventor to set some simple rules.	
This team is a mess. Gather everybody on the field. I'll knock that spirit back into you guys if I have to.	-1
Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.	3
Come on, I'll show you the best spots around!	
Leventor	
Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Leventor seems to be sick of this.	
Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Leventor!	1
Iron Claw!	-1
Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)	3
Leventor	
Leventor seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.	
The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.	3
Let's open up a bright future with this ball.	
Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)	
Leventor	
Leventor caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?	
I think we should hang him.	
Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.	3
You came to see my marvelous moves? I'm flattered.	-1
Leventor	
Leventor seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see a problem with that as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.	3
I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great.	
Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!	
Leventor	
Leventor says he doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. He thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.	
I think you two have something common...	-1
Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.	3
Hmm? That is odd... What do you think about this?	
Leventor	
It seems that Leventor is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?	
Listen carefully and you'll find him.	
Let's ask Khirel to find him...	
Leventor? Nah, he never gets lost.	3
Leventor	
You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.	
If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.	3
I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.	
Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.	
Leventor	
Leventor is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to him.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	1
I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.	-1
Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.	3
Leventor	
Leventor, who is determined to make everything in his life, even his dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.	
It was an intense feeling as if I was going against the strongest team in the universe.	1
I've never dreamt about soccer.	
I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.	
Leventor	
Leventor plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.	
I'm thinking of opening a shop.	
We'll see about it after the League.	
I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.	-1
	
Griffith	
You come across Griffith who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?	
I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.	
Trust me and your teammates. Sit this one out.	-1
Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.	3
Griffith	
Griffith says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?	
That's unacceptable!	
You can only find your true potential when you don't rely on your skills!	1
Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.	
Griffith	
Griffith is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.	
Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.	3
It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy! This is nonsense!	
We haven't awakened our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyond!	
Griffith	
The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?	
Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.	
We didn't play dirty, right?	1
They will never learn with an attitude like that.	3
Griffith	
Griffith is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?	
We can overcome this like always, right?	
It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.	
Let's solve the problems one by one.	1
Griffith	
Ogre's pony tail slapped Griffith in the face!	
Even his hair is a weapon! Is that allowed?	1
That must hurt.	
Ugh...Gross...	
Griffith	
Griffith says that the Swirlies are missing.	
They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.	
They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.	3
I evolved them.	
	
Eden	
Eden is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.	
Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.	
It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy! This is nonsense!	
We haven't awakend our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyond!	-1
Eden	
Eden's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?	
If you keep it up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.	1
Remember that feeling and use it when things get rough.	
Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.	3
Eden	
Eden seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.	
Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones	
Maybe if you increase your Strength...	-1
Don't be weak.	
Eden	
During a match, Eden bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep on going.	
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.	-1
Eden	
Ogre's pony tail slapped Eden in the face!	
Even his hair is a weapon! Is that allowed?	
That must hurt.	3
Ugh...Gross...	
Eden	
Eden seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see a problem with that as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.	-1
I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great.	1
Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!	3
Eden	
Eden is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.	
Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.	1
Well, having a good ace skill is a start.	
Flawless skills.	
Eden	
Eden says that the Swirlies are missing.	
They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.	-1
They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.	
I evolved them.	
Eden	
Eden is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.	
Impressive! You've the ace of this team now!	3
You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.	
I knew this day would come	
Eden	
Eden says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.	
Hmm, a revived person that forgot his purpose...Reminds me of somebody.	-1
He'll remember someday.	
That's bad. I'm sure it's something important!	
Eden	
Eden is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.	
Yeah. I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!	3
Life, eh? I guess that's a bit too serious for me, but I think I understand how you feel.	
And that's how we walk towards our destiny.	
Eden	
Eden is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.	
This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!	
Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!	
How about some presents for your parents?	1
Eden	
Eden is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	-1
I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.	
Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.	
Eden	
Eden is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.	
It's surpising to see such advanced technology.	-1
Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.	
Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.	
Eden	
Eden seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?	
I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.	3
The eyepatch...I wonder if she washes it. She seems to have it on at all times.	
That'sa  dangerous secret you're trying to find out about. Do you still want to know?	
	
Meg	
It's dinner time and Meg is staring at her carrot soup with a troubled look. What should we do?	
(Eat it instead of her.)	
(Tell her to put the carrots in the soup on Hildegard's plate.)	-1
(Tell her the carrots are good for the body and eat it all.)	
	
AU96 Karpila	
Karpila is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.	
Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!	3
Life, eh? I guess that's a bit too serious for me, but I think I understand how you feel.	1
And that's how we walk towards our destiny.	
AU96 Karpila	
Karpila is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.	
They're on cooldown.	3
They support us from the shadows.	-1
Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?	-1
AU96 Karpila	
Karpila says that the Swirlies are missing.	
They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.	
They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.	3
I evolved them.	
AU96 Karpila	
With a serious face, Karpila is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.	
Being together is enough for me.	-1
A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?	
Well, I'm sure we'll get an answer when we get to the end of this.	-1
AU96 Karpila	
The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.	
I can't stand this...I need to end this quickly and go take a shower.	
What a depressing weather...	
Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!	3
AU96 Karpila	
You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.	
...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...	
Ugh...I want to dig my eyes out.	-1
Fontus...You sure are my archnemesis!	1
AU96 Karpila	
Karpila plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.	
I'm thinking of opening a shop.	3
We'll see about it after the League.	
I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.	
AU96 Karpila	
Karpila came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	
Let's work up a solution.	1
I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.	1
Just please go with that boring strategy.	
AU96 Karpila	
Karpila is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.	
It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.	3
Do I have to stop the match?	
It's time, Karpila! Awaken the 6th attribute and show your true powers!	
AU96 Karpila	
Karpila is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.	
Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!.	
You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.	1
I knew this day would come.	-1
AU96 Karpila	
Karpila picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.	
So, this is how the revolution begins!	
Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke of course...	3
Let's contact her and return this.	
AU96 Karpila	
Karpila wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?	
Perfect planning and perfect execution.	1
All goes as planned...Hmm? Just ignore that.	-1
Why don't you join them and find out?	
AU96 Karpila	
Karpila is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	
I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.	3
Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.	
AU96 Karpila	
You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!	
Cool! Awesome!	3
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	
...Uh...So no soccer?	
AU96 Karpila	
Karpila thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.	
That's because you haven't opened up your "third eye"!	-1
Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?	
Hmm, her tail is a bit weird and her eyes are definitely human...	1
AU96 Karpila	
Karpila seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.	
They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.	3
It's just a myth. Forget about it.	
Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.	
AU96 Karpila	
Karpila seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.	
I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great.	
Is there someone on the team that you like? Go propose!	3
AU96 Karpila	
It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?	
I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.	
I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.	
Wow, congratulations! (Claps)	3
AU96 Karpila	
Ogre's pony tail slapped Karpila in the face!	
Even his hair is a weapon! Is that allowed?	
That must hurt.	3
Ugh...Gross...	
AU96 Karpila	
Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?	
The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!	
Has he gone mad?	3
I guess he's happy this is a good match.	
AU96 Karpila	
Karpila is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.	
Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.	
It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy! This is nonsense.	
We haven't awakened our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyond!	-1
	
Hildegard	
Hildegard is looking excited and asks how the match went.	
The other team went home crying!	
They were a worthy opponent.	1
I led our team to victory with wedgies!	
Hildegard	
Hildegard is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?	
I don't think you need to worry about a diet.	3
You're playing soccer! You're fine!	
Please don't forget about the match.	
Hildegard	
Hildegard says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.	
Tell them they should remember that they play for you.	3
Just hear them out and smile. They'll feel better.	
You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.	
Hildegard	
MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.	
Stop right there!	
Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?	-1
...Maybe he just likes cats!	1
Hildegard	
Hildegard is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.	
It's only a sport! The strongest team wins, and we are strong!	3
I'm sure everybody's feeling the same way you feel.	
Aren't you the one everybody should be afraid of?	1
Hildegard	
Hildegard wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.	
Beginner level monsters in an RPG game.	1
Thankful beings that will be our +160.	3
I'm planning to make a whole line of merchandise with them as the character.	
Hildegard	
Hildegard suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.	
What's the agenda here? Are you trying to taint the pure angels?	
This is a good chance to show the baby angels how rough soccer can be!	3
That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.	
Hildegard	
Hildegard is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.	
I hope you get scouted by an interesting team.	1
Make the scouters fall in love with your performance!	3
Let's make that our goal and make it happen.	-1
Hildegard	
Hildegard says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?	
Of course! Everybody is counting on you!	
Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.	
I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.	3
Hildegard	
According to Hildegard's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.	
I want to see Tyler's true characteristics.	
William doesn't know to respect his seniors.	3
I thought they were just friends.	
Hildegard	
The match and the concert that Hildegard was looking for start at the same time...	
Let's hack the big screen so we can see the concert!	-1
Channel that sorrow and rage towards your opponents and make them pay.	
I'm sorry that you couldn't go.	
Hildegard	
Hildegard thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?	
First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.	1
Of course we should tell Lynbell! What are you waiting for?	-1
...Sometimes, the truth is better to be left a secret.	
Hildegard	
Hildegard is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.	
Do you think they'll be tasty?	
I think they're cute and elegant if you leave out the pig and bear.	
I'd like to keep one as a pet.	-1
Hildegard	
The match started and Hildegard is standing still doing nothing.	
What is she doing? Is she a totem?	
Run! Just start running!	3
Looks like we'll have to do without her.	
Hildegard	
Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Hildegard seems to be troubled. What should we do?	
If you guys keep giving Hildegard trouble, I swear to god I'll use you both as special training material.	-1
If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?	
You both need to be disciplined be Hildegard.	
Hildegard	
Hildegard seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?	
Congradulations! How did you guys get along?	-1
Don't forget that we exist! Haha!	
Good for you! I know it's hard for you to find someone at your level!	
Hildegard	
Hildegard says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.	
That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy and love.	3
I think she likes him.	
Maybe she's up to something.	
Hildegard	
You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Hildegard and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.	
Let's give her some space.	
I could really use some grilled sweet potatoes and chestnuts.	-1
There's no time for tears! Find out who did this and bring justice!	
Hildegard	
Hildegard wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.	
Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.	1
The character story left him a trauma.	
Maybe he just wants to duke it out.	
Hildegard	
Hildegard isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.	
Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.	-1
Let's invest some crystals and get new players!	
We may have to go rough on the team and make them realize the problem.	
Hildegard	
Hildegard claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?	
She must've made a mistake.	
Maybe Sophie is actually male...?	
I don't care what the case is.	3
	
Felix	
Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Felix seems to be troubled. What should we do?	
If you guys keep giving Felix trouble, I swear to god I'll use you both as special training material.	3
If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?	-1
You both need to be disciplined be Felix.	
Felix	
It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?	
I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.	
I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.	-1
Wow, congratulations! (Claps)	
Felix	
Felix says he's the center of the team and asks if you agree with him. How should we answer?	
Of course! Everybody is counting on you!	
Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.	
I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.	1
Felix	
Felix is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give him an opinion.	
This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!	
Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!	
How about some presents for your parents?	1
Felix	
Felix went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?	
We should think about how to make fun of him when he comes back.	
I feel sorry for the other team.	
Felix is in danger! We have to save him!	3
Felix	
Felix says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to him?	
That's unacceptable!	
You can only find your true potential when you don't rely on your skills!	
Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.	3
	
Raklet	
Raklet came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	
Let's work up a solution.	3
I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.	
Just please go with that boring strategy.	
Raklet	
Raklet is teasing her opponent that is having a hard time chasing her. What should we do?	
What are you going to do when that player falls in love with you?	-1
Well, that player is kind of cute...	
Stop goofing around and play the game.	3
Raklet	
Raklet is planning to go on a blind date with a close teammate. Should we say something to her?	
Just stay out of trouble.	3
Come talk to me before you fall in love at first sight.	-1
Don't get greedy and go for all of the men.	
Raklet	
Raklet is worried about Vermilion Bird. She thinks something is troubling Vermilion Bird.	
Maybe this is something about love and hate. It may be something serious.	-1
Didn't he grow up being friends with the princess? I think I know what's going on...	-1
Maybe being the heir of an honorable family has its burdens.	
Raklet	
Raklet isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.	
Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.	3
Let's invest some crystals and get new players!	
We may have to go rough on the team and make them realize the problem.	-1
Raklet	
Raklet is having trouble finding a Spirit Stone that fits her needs and taste. Let's give her advice.	
How about Metatron's Will? It's cute with the butterfly decorations.	-1
I recommend the pure Paradise of Light.	3
What about Silent Cold? You'll be able to hold onto your opponents.	-1
Raklet	
It seems that Raklet is wondering what to do after a teammate proposed to her. It doesn't seem that she's not entirely uninterested. What should we do?	
Just make sure that it doesn't affect him on the field. 	-1
Why don't you start with trading diaries?	3
It's not like you to be kind to everybody.Just go and say no.	
Raklet	
Kaidormu of the United Explorers is praising Raklet's plays. Let's add in.	
Be careful not to fall in love with her.	-1
Yeah, she's as charming as you!	
You just got praised by Kaidormu! That's awesome!	3
Raklet	
Raklet, who seems to be interested in Eve, is asking your opinion about her. What should we tell her?	
I'm worried that you two may go around causing trouble if you two are together.	-1
Maybe she would be too much for you.	
Maybe you could become a couple if you really really like her.	
Raklet	
The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.	
Let's see what you have to say after the match.	3
I didn't know I was a talented foot volleyball player!	
Care to receive the ball with your face?	
Raklet	
With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Raklet for solutions.	
We won't be able to win the league if we fail to overcome this.	1
I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a change.	
How about we put the advantaged technology of Metro City to use?	
Raklet	
According to Raklet's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.	
I want to see Tyler's true characteristics.	
William doesn't know how to respect his seniors.	
I thought they were just friends.	3
Raklet	
A defender on the other team seems to have fallen in love with Raklet and is chasing her around the field. It looks like the player forgot about the match. What should we do?	
Nobody can resist that charm of yours.	-1
Come to me! I'll take care of it!	3
That's like playing with fire.	
Raklet	
Raklet thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?	
First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.	3
Of course we should tell Lynbell! What are you waiting for?	
...Sometimes, the truth is better to be left a secret.	
Raklet	
The match started and Raklet is standing still doing nothing.	
What is she doing? Is she a totem?	1
Run! Just start running!	-1
Looks like we'll have to do without her.	
Raklet	
You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Raklet and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.	
Let's give her some space.	
I could really use some grilled sweet potatoes and chestnuts.	-1
There's no time for tears! Find out who did this and bring justice!	
Raklet	
Raklet's uniform is all messed up because of the filthy plays of her opponent. What should we do?	
(Give her a new uniform.)	3
(Tell her it's not the opponent showing affection and it's nothing but foul plays.)	
(It won't be long until the opponent becomes mezmerized by Raklet's charms.)	
Raklet	
The team manger ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?	
We could start a reset marathon.	
We're going to hunt that manager down and take back our money. We will show no mercy!	-1
Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.	
Raklet	
You're sick and in bed when Raklet and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?	
You guys... I'm about to cry...	
I'm sorry... I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...	3
Get closer so I can spread my germs!	
Raklet	
The match and the concert that Raklet was looking for start at the same time...	
Let's hack the big screen so we can see the concert!	
Channel that sorrow and rage towards your opponents and make them pay.	
I'm sorry that you couldn't go.	3
Raklet	
This was the worst game in your entire life...Raklet comes to you to cheer you up.	
Please explain why you kicked the ball into our goal post, will you?	
Thanks...I know you're the one that's the most devastated...Let's do better next time.	1
Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.	3
Raklet	
Raklet seems to be planning to enter for the Galaxy League Mascot Contest. Let's talk to her.	
I mean...You may intimidate the crowd...But I guess that could be your charm?	
Mascot? More like a super model. You are too good looking to be a mere mascot.	
I think it'll suit you well.	3
Raklet	
The team became furious after seeing Raklet fall by the focused attack of the opposing team and used that fury to win the game. Let's say something.	
You did well. Don't worry!	
You can rely on your teammates in situations like this.	1
Your beauty is a curse.	
Raklet	
Raklet asks what you think is the most important ability in soccer. Give her an answer.	
Excitement and elegance. The fans love it.	
Fair spirit and sportsmanship.	3
Getting to know your opponents up to the point of falling in love with them...And then crushing them.	
Raklet	
Raklet is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.	
It's only a sport! The strongest team wins, and we are strong!	1
I'm sure everybody's feeling the same way you feel.	
Aren't you the one everybody should be afraid of?	
Raklet	
Raklet is asking what it would be like to date an alien. Give her your opinion.	
I believe it'll be romantic.	1
I guess the platonic side would be important.	
I believe there was an old movie about an alien infiltrating a spaceship...	
Raklet	
Raklet wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.	
Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.	3
The character story left him a trauma.	
Maybe he just wants to duke it out.	
	
Ravi	
Ravi is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.	
I would've tried to find something that fits me.	
Something full of excitement!	
I would've been doing something to save the universe.	-1
	
Guinevere	
Guinevere is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.	
I'm afraid to be honest.	-1
I was always lookng forward for that moment.	
Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes, will you?	
Guinevere	
A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Guinevere. What should you say?	
Well, Guinevere does have that kind of charm.	
Well, you're as cute as Guinevere.	1
I hope you two become good rivals.	
Guinevere	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	-1
Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.	1
Let's give them a hand.	
Guinevere	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Guinevere having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match.	3
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?	
...I see two idiots standing in front of me...	
Guinevere	
You come across Sammy while walking the street with Guinevere. Let's talk to her.	
We'll win next time!	3
Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.	1
(Ignore.)	
Guinevere	
Guinevere is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.	
I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.	1
The fans love your performance!	
Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.	
Guinevere	
Guinevere is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.	
Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes. You're a precious part of this team.	-1
Don't be anxious. Have faith and keep following me.	-1
That's why I need your help.	
Guinevere	
Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Guinevere.	
I think he felt better because of the positive energy you always have around you.	1
Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?	
You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.	
Guinevere	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Guinevere asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel like I can fly" or something?	
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	3
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	
Guinevere	
The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Guinevere do?	
(Give her instructions so that she can do her share of the cleaning quickly.)	
(Let her take some of the team memebers and allow them to clean freely.)	3
(Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.)	
	
Blade	
During a match, Blade bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep going.	1
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.	3
Blade	
Blade seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your preformance on the field.	
I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great.	3
Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!	
Blade	
Blade looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.	
It's space. Anything can exist here.	
How about we ask Jeunese?	
Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.	-1
MX87 Lukia	
Lukia is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.	
Impressive! You've the ace of this team now!	3
You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.	
I knew this day would come	
MX87 Lukia	
As Lukia said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	3
MX87 Lukia	
Lukia picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.	
So, this is how the revolution begins!	
Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke of course...	
Let's contact her and return this.	1
MX87 Lukia	
Lukia says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?	
That's unacceptable!	
You can only find your true potential when you don't rely on your skills!	1
Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.	
MX87 Lukia	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	1
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	
MX87 Lukia	
A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Lukia.	
It's like he's mocking us!	3
It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.	
He still has two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.	
MX87 Lukia	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Lukia asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel like I can fly" or something?	
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	3
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	
MX87 Lukia	
Lukia is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.	
I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.	1
The fans love your performance!	
Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.	
MX87 Lukia	
Lukia thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.	
That's because you haven't opened up your "third eye"!	-1
Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?	
Hmm, her tail is a bit weird and her ears are definitely human...	
MX87 Lukia	
The team will not have a match for some time. Lukia asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.	
Hmm, wanna go shopping?	
I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.	1
MX87 Lukia	
Lukia is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.	
(Put your thumbs up, win, and send a jucy smile.)	3
(Pat her on the head.)	
(Just nod your head.)	
MX87 Lukia	
Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.	
Well, now what?	
Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?	-1
A crow?!	
MX87 Lukia	
Lukia has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.	
You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.	
Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it. You should keep that going.	3
I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.	
MX87 Lukia	
Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Lukia is curious and wants to take a look.	
We should probably ignore them and just walk by.	
Let's go help them!	3
They must love volunteer work!	-1
MX87 Lukia	
Lukia brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...	1
Throw it away. NOW.	
Drink it up!	
MX87 Lukia	
Lukia scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!	
Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?	
That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!	
You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!	3
MX87 Lukia	
You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.	
...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...	3
Ugh...I want to dig my eyes out.	
Fontus...You sure are my archnemesis!	
MX87 Lukia	
Lukia lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?	
Well, this could have been prevented if you just consumes those Swirlies like I told you...	
I will avenge you!	3
	
ZUXX Robin	
Robin says he wants to cry because the goal keeper on the other team just won't go down no matter how many shots he makes.	
Let's start by picking their defenses apart.	
Let's come up with a new strategy to give you more synergy.	
I'll come up with a formation that can bring the best out of everyboby.	1
ZUXX Robin	
Robin suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.	
What's the agenda here? Are you trying to taint the pure angels?	
This is a good chance to show the baby angels how rough soccer can be!	
That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.	-1
ZUXX Robin	
It's Robin's birthday. Let's give him a present.	
Here! I made some cookies with the team.	1
I stole this treasure box from Kuma.	
This is a championship trophy replica for you. The designs are inspired by you. 	
ZUXX Robin	
Robin comes to you and says that he has to leave the team because of personal reasons. What should we say?	
Well, I don't want to be the one holding you back. Good luck!	
There will always be a place for you to return.	1
So, how does this work do I tap "Sell"?	
ZUXX Robin	
Robin is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to him.	
I want you to form a team and catch every single bear near this locker room.	
...If you want to say something, it's alright. I'll be listening.	-1
Let's go tell the manager.	
	
Z225 Ramia	
Ramia is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.	
It's only a sport! The strongest team wins, and we are strong!	
I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.	
Aren't you the one everybody should be afraid of?	3
	
Vayne	
Vayne is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.	
I'm sure you're going to become an integalatic fool.	
I..Respect your naming taste...	
Cool! Keep it up!	1
Vayne	
Vayne is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.	
We need a decent level of personal performance.	
What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?	
Wreck the other team.	1
Vayne	
Vayne looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.	
It's space. Anything can exist here.	3
How about we ask Jeunese?	
Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.	
	
DU007 Nute	
There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?	
What's done is done. Let's come up with a new design.	1
It's finally time for some festival-soccer!	3
Let's split up and find the uniforms.	
DU007 Nute	
Nute is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?	
I don't think you need to worry about a diet.	
You're playing soccer! You're fine!	1
Please don't forget about the match.	
DU007 Nute	
Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Nute seems to be troubled. What should we do?	
If you guys keep giving Nute trouble, I swear to god I'll use you both as special training material.	1
If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?	3
You both need to be disciplined by Nute.	
DU007 Nute	
Nute is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing any problems.	
You're right. This is a waste of time.	
The honor of our opponent is also important.	-1
That team is far from your style.	
	
Marianne	
Marianne is asking you if you ever saw the World Tree. Let's tell her your thoughts.	
Let's not talk about anything irrelevant to the match.	
It's something I'd want to see again with a person I care.	-1
It's nothing but a tree.	
Marianne	
You come across Marianne being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.	
Are you feeling alright?	1
Don't use that ability on the field...	
Don't worry, I'll go with you.	
Marianne	
Marianne seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.	
It's thanks to you! Thanks for listening to my instructions!	
I'm starting to see true strength in this team.	1
Perfect! No mistakes made!	
Marianne	
You're having a conversation with Marianne about the power of Spirit Stones which is covered in secrets. Let's tell her what you think.	
I need a Spirit Stone that's as fancy as I am.	
I won't rely on Spirit Stones.	1
I would buy them all if I could.	
Mute	
Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.	
Well, now what?	
Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?	-1
A crow?!	1
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Aiolos	
Aiolos is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.	
My teammates and their flawless play!	
My friends from previous life...They would be pleased to see me win.	
My fans!	3
Aiolos	
Aiolos is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.	
Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!	
Life, eh? I guess that's a bit too serious for me, but I think I understand how you feel.	
And that's how we walk towards our destiny.	3
Aiolos	
Aiolos is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.	
If you're better than your teammates, you should be the one to be considerate.	3
I'm not comfortable with this conversation.	
He can be irritating.	
Aiolos	
Aiolos is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.	
Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.	3
It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy! This is nonsense!	
We haven't awakened our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyond!	
Aiolos	
Aiolos is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''	
Not again...	
Let's do this! I'm at your disposal!	3
I like what you just said.	1
Aiolos	
Aiolos picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.	
So, this is how the revelation begins!	-1
Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...	
Let's contact her and return this.	1
Aiolos	
Aiolos says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.	
Hmm, a revived person that forgot his purpose...Reminds me of somebody.	
He'll remember someday.	3
That's bad. I'm sure it's something important!	1
Aiolos	
Aiolos says that the Swirlies are missing.	
They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.	
They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.	3
I evolved them.	
Aiolos	
Aiolos, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal who you really are. What should we answer?	
To become the strongest being in space! I shall tramp on everything that stands in my path!	1
Just playing soccer, that's all.	
To bring justice with soccer. That's all.	
Aiolos	
Let's talk to Aiolos who recently started to take interest in the world of angels.	
It's a place to rest for the good.	-1
I'm sure it'd be full of hypocrites.	1
I hope it's not a boring place.	
Aiolos	
The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.	
I can't stand this...I need to end this quickly and go take a shower.	1
What a depressing weather...	
Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!	
Aiolos	
The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?	
A square match is what suites a proud royalty.	3
Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?	
That has nothing to do with us.	
Aiolos	
The teammates are speaking highly of Aiolos, saying she's a good role model. Let's add in.	
Thank you for doing whatever it takes to win.	
She shows dominance with elegance.	
She's truly a role model to us all with her skills and attitude.	-1
Aiolos	
You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?	
I feel sorry, but that's irrelevant to the match.	
This is going to be a cake walk.	
I'm considering making an anonymous donation.	3
Aiolos	
You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.	
How can I earn gold? Where do I have to go to find the REAL Underground?	
It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.	3
So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.	
Aiolos	
You're having a conversation with Aiolos about the power of Spirit Stones which is covered in secrets. Let's tell her what you think.	
I need a Spirit Stone that's as fancy as I am.	
I won't rely on Spirit Stones.	
I would buy them all if I could.	1
Aiolos	
Aiolos says to you that it was an honor to be able to play with you. Let's give her an answer.	
Let's do our best until the very end.	1
I never imagined that i'd be used like this.	
I'm starting to enjoy playing wtth you.	
	
Neraizel	
Neraizel says that the Swirlies are missing.	
They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.	
They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.	3
I evolved them.	1
Neraizel	
Neraizel says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.	
Hmm, a revived person that forgot his purpose... Reminds me of somebody.	-1
He'll remember someday.	
That's bad.I'm sure it's something important!	
Neraizel	
Neraizel, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal who you really are. What should we answer?	
To become the strongest being in space! I shall tramp on everything that stands in my path!	1
Just playing soccer, that's all.	
To bring justice with soccer. That's all.	
Neraizel	
You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.	
How can I earn gold? Where do I have to go to find the REAL Underground?	
It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.	3
So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.	-1
Neraizel	
Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Neraizel wants to say a word.	
Get yourselves together, guys. Are you going to give up already?	3
Come on guys, you know it's an exciting thing to be playing against a strong team! Keep your heads up high!	-1
They will be sacrificed for our victory and honor.	1
Neraizel	
Neraizel is asking you if you ever saw the World Tree. Let's tell her your thoughts.	
Let's not talk about anything irrelevant to the match.	3
It's something I'd want to see again with a person I care.	-1
It's nothing but a tree.	1
Neraizel	
Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?	
We will confront them fair and square, and win.	1
I'll go blow up their lodging.	
Pathetic. We'll show them that we're better in many ways.	3
Neraizel	
Neraizel is thinking about what the Universe of Oblivion is.	
Don't be scared of such petty things.	3
I don't like the word oblivion.	
I don't care as long as it doesn't harm me.	
Neraizel	
Neraizel is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.	
If you're better than your teammates, you should be the one to be considerate.	3
I'm not comfortable with this conversation.	1
He can be irritating.	1
Neraizel	
Neraizel is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.	
Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.	3
It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy! This is nonsense!	
We haven't awakened our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyond!	
Neraizel	
Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.	
Well, now what?	
Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?	-1
A crow?!	3
Neraizel	
You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?	
I feel sorry, but that's irrelevant to the match.	
This is going to be a cake walk.	-1
I'm considering making an anonymous donation.	3
Neraizel	
Neraizel is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''	
Not again...	
Let's do this! I'm at your disposal!	3
I like what you just said.	
Neraizel	
Neraizel points out that the time the men of Minerva died and the time the epidemic broke out in Metro City matches.	
I think that had something to do with dirty money.	
It would disgust me if that was the result of an evil plot.	3
That's too convenient to be a coincidence.	
Neraizel	
Cracsus threatens to hack Neraizel's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?	
Let's blackmail Robin that we'll pluck out of his plants.	1
I contacted Hildegard.	-1
Don't fall for this cheap shot.	1
Neraizel	
Mortor and Wizol of the Peacemakers are helping an old man. Neraizel seems to be surprised.	
Well, what do you know! They have some decency in them after all.	
Hmmm.	
It's good to know that they're not shallow people.	3
Neraizel	
Neraizel seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?	
I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.	3
The eyepatch...I wonder if she washes it. She seems to have it on at all time.	
That's a dangerous secret you're trying to find out about. Do you still want to know?	
Neraizel	
Neraizel is thinking about what Selena said about saving the galaxy if we win the Galaxy League.	
Then we should do our very best to win.	-1
I can play along if there's something in it for me.	-1
It's not good to believe what others say.	3
Neraizel	
This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?	
Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.	3
I heard that the bath products on Earth are the best in the universe.	1
I'm going to check out the new comic issues. Wanna come along?	
Neraizel	
Neraizel is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.	
This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!	1
Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!	3
How about some presents for your parents?	
Neraizel	
Neraizel is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.	
Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!	3
Life, eh? I guess that's a bit too serious for me, but I think I understand how you feel.	1
And that's how we walk towards our destiny. 	
Neraizel	
A big fight broke out between an angel and a demon within the team. Neraizel is asking for help.	
I'm going to pick sides of the one I like.	3
I hope the demon didn't say anything stupid.	
Maybe the angel said something irritating again.	
Neraizel	
Neraizel is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.	
My teammates and their flawless play!	1
My friends from previus life...They would be pleased to see me win.	-1
My fans!	3
Neraizel	
You're having a conversation with Neraizel about the power of Spirit Stones which is covered in secrets. Let's tell her what you think.	
I need a Spirit Stone that's as fancy as I am.	3
I won't rely on Spirit Stones.	
I would buy them all if I could.	1
Neraizel	
You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.	
...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...	3
Ugh...I want to dig my eyes out.	
Fontus...You sure are my archnemesis!	
Neraizel	
Neraizel is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.	
Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!	3
You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.	
I knew this day would come.	
Neraizel	
It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?	
I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.	
I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.	
Wow, congratulations! (Claps)	3
Neraizel	
Ogre's pony tail slapped Neraizel in the face!	
Even his hair is a weapon! Is that even allowed? 	-1
That must hurt.	3
Ugh...Gross...	1
Neraizel	
Neraizel says to you that it was an honor to be able to play with you. Let's give her an answer.	
Let's do our best until the very end.	1
I never imagined that I'd be used like this.	
I'm starting to enjoy playing with you.	3
Neraizel	
Let's talk to Neraizel who recently started to take interest in the world of angels.	
It's a place to rest for the good.	-1
I'm sure it'd be full of hypocrites.	
I hope it's not a boring place.	3
Neraizel	
Neraizel says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?	
That's unacceptable!	
You can only find your true potential when you don't rely on your skills!	
Well, we can't do anyting about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.	3
Neraizel	
The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?	
A square match is what suites a proud royalty.	3
Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?	
That has nothing to do with us.	
Neraizel	
Neraizel wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?	
Perfect planning and perfect execution	1
All goes as planned....Hmm? Just ignore that.	
Why don't you join them and find out?	
	
Kiki	
It's a very intense match and Kiki falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Kiki up and the two exchange smiles.	
Guess the match isn't tough for you, huh?	
True sportsmanship! Wonderful!	1
That player must have a heart of gold.	3
Kiki	
The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?	
Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.	
We didn't play dirty, right?	
They will never learn with an attitude like that.	3
Kiki	
Kiki was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.	
Oh. that'll be so cute.	3
It would be good to have one of each color. and when they're all grown up... Make' em into a good meal!	
We can play soccer with the penguins.	1
Kiki	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Kiki asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel like I can fly" or something?	
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	1
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	3
Kiki	
You come across Sammy while walking the street with Kiki. Let's talk to her.	
We'll win next time!	1
Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.	3
(Ignore.)	
Kiki	
Kiki is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.	
(Puts your thumbs up, wink, and send a juicy smile.)	
(Pats her on the head.)	3
(Just nod your head.)	
Kiki	
Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Kiki.	
I think he felt better because of the positive energy you always have around you.	1
Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?	3
You saved us all from awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.	
Kiki	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	3
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	-1
Kiki	
You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.	
Can't you cook ramen by yourself?	3
Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.	
Is Marilyn your mother or nanny?	1
Kiki	
Kiki seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.	
It's thanks to you! Thanks for listening to my instructions!	1
I'm starting to see true strength in this team.	3
Perfect! No mistakes made!	-1
Kiki	
Kiki falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?	
If that's all you got, just stay down. It's okay.	-1
Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!	-1
Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.	3
Kiki	
Latios is chatting with Kiki after the match. Let's barge in.	
Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's our pretty girl.	-1
Kiki was fantastic on the field, right?	1
I'm looking forward to our next match!	3
Kiki	
You're watching the storm with Kiki and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.	
Is something troubling her? I'm having a bad feeling.	-1
What's wrong with her?	3
She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!	-1
Kiki	
You come across Kiki being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.	
Are you feeling alright?	3
Don't use that ability on the field...	-1
Don't worry, I'll go with you.	-1
Kiki	
A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Kiki. What should you say?	
Well, Kiki does have that kind of charm.	3
Well, you're cute as Kiki.	
I hope you two become good rivals.	
Kiki	
Kiki is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.	
I'm afraid to be honest.	
I was always looking forward for that moment.	3
Stay by my side and make sure i don't make any mistakes, will you?	
Kiki	
Kiki looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.	
Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.	-1
Don't worry. Leave it up to me.	-1
Littre will be fine.	3
Kiki	
Kiki is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?	
Don't worry about me! Do your job!	
Can you peel this guy off of me?	3
Don't come over here! It's dangerous!	-1
Kiki	
Kiki lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?	3
Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...	
I will avenge you!	
Kiki	
You come across Kiki who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?	
I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.	-1
Trust me and your teammates. Sit this one out.	-1
Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.	3
Kiki	
Kiki's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Kiki seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.	
That player is just messing with you.	3
I think that player likes you.	1
You're doing fine. Don't play your opponent's game.	
Kiki	
Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Kiki is curious and wants to take a look.	
We should probably ignore them and just walk by.	
Let's go help them!	1
They must love volunteer work!	3
Kiki	
You find Kiki depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.	
Don't mind. It's our fault. We weren't able to make use of your strength	
You did well and thank you for that	3
It's not your fault that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!	
Kiki	
Kiki is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.	
Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes. You're a precious part of this team.	-1
Don't be anxious. Have faith and keep following me.	-1
That's why I need your help.	3
Kiki	
The crowd is cheering for Kiki. Kiki seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.	
They're all in love with your enthusiatic play.	1
They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.	3
How about just accepting the compliments for today?	
Kiki	
The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Kiki do?	
(Give her instructions so that she can do her share of the cleaning quickly.)	
(Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely)	3
(Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.)	
Kiki	
The team will not have a match for some time. Kiki asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.	-1
Hmmm, wanna go shopping?	
I have a very hard training session all planed up for everybody.	
Kiki	
Kiki is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.	
I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.	-1
The fans love your performance!	1
Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.	3
Kiki	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	-1
Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.	1
Let's give them a hand.	3
Kiki	
Kiki brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drink looks really scary... But we can't just throw it away...	3
Throw it away. NOW.	-1
Drink it up!	1
Kiki	
A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Kiki.	
I feel like he's mocking us!	-1
It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.	
He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.	
Kiki	
Kiki is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?	
You can overcome this like always. Right?	3
It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that look the opponents off guard.	
Let's solve the problems one by one.	
Kiki	
Kiki is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.	
I'll sleep by your side tonight.	-1
I see. We must be careful. I'll be watching over you.	
It's just a dream. Forget about it.	
Kiki	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Kiki having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match.	
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?	3
...I see two idiots standing in front of me...	
Kiki	
The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Kiki and her opponent isn't over yet.	
You better win that fight!	3
Hey! The match is over!	
I've never seen her worked up that much.	-1
Kiki	
Kiki scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!	
Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?	
That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!	-1
You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!	1
Kiki	
Kiki suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.	3
How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.	
Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!	
Kiki	
Kiki has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.	
You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.	-1
Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it. You should keep that going.	-1
I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.	
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.	1
I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great.	
Is there someone on that team that you like. Go propose!	
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.	
I'm thinking of opening a shop.	-1
We'll see about it after the League.	
I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.	
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.	
It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.	3
Do I have to stop the match?	
It's time, Black Tortoise! Awaken the 6th attribute and show your true powers!	-1
Black Tortoise	
You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.	
If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.	
I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.	3
Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.	
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?	
If you keep up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.	1
Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.	3
Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.	
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.	
This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!	1
Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!	3
How about some presents for your parents	
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.	
Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.	-1
Maybe if you increase your Strength..	1
Don't be weak.	3
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?	
It's the place when the chosen ones learn about their destiny.	
It's the place of dreams colliding.	3
It's stressful because we can't prepare for extraterrestrial sanitation. We're completely exposed to all those unknown...things.	-1
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.	
They're on cooldown.	
They support us from the shadows.	1
Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?	3
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	3
I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.	
Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.	1
Black Tortoise	
With a serious face, Black Tortoise is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.	
Being together is enough for me.	3
A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?	1
Well, I'm sure we'll get an answer when we get to the end of this.	
Black Tortoise	
Ogre's pony tail slapped Black Tortoise in the face!	
Even his hair is a weapon! Is that even allowed?	
That must hurt	3
Ugh... gross...	1
Black Tortoise	
You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.	
...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...	3
Ugh...I want to dig my eyes out.	
Fontus...You sure are my archnemesis!	
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?	
I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.	3
The eyepatch... I wonder if she washes it. She seems to have it on at all times.	
That's a dangerous secret you're trying to find out about. Do you still want to know?	-1
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.	
It's surprising to see such advanced technology.	
Well, i have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.	3
Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price,	
Black Tortoise	
The team is having a good run and Black Tortoise is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.	
Let's keep this momentum going!	3
As long as we're not used as training material...	-1
There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.	
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?	
Perfect planning and perfect execution	1
All goes as planned... Hmm? Just ignore that.	
Why don't you join them and find out?	3
Black Tortoise	
Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.	
Well, now what?	1
Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?	-1
A crow?!	3
Black Tortoise	
During a match, Black Tortoise bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep on going.	
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself	3
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?	
That's unnacceptable!	
You can only find your true potential when you don't rely on your skills!	
Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.	3
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.	
That's because you haven't opened up your "third eye"!	-1
Isn't that the same with all other Beastmen?	3
Hmm, her tail is a bit weird and her ears are definitely human...	1
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.	
Everybody is not at 100%.But,I think we'll do better sooner or later.	3
It's all because no body on this team cares about strategy!This is nonsense!	
We haven't awakened our TRUE power!We have to go further beyond!	
Black Tortoise	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Black Tortoise is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously. 	3
He's obviously obsessed with soccer. 	
This is good. We can use this chance to break their backline.	1
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.	
Yeah,I understand you.Soccer is so much fun!	3
Life,eh? I guess that's a bit too serious forme,but I think I understand how you feel.	
And that's how we walk towards out destiny.	-1
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.	
They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.	-1
It's just a myth. Forget about it.	1
Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.	3
Black Tortoise	
Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?	
The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!	3
Has he gone mad?	
I guess he's happy this is a good match.	1
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.	
Hmm, a revived person that forgot his purpose...Reminds me of somebody.	
He'll remeber someday.	3
That's sad. I'm sure it's something important!	
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.	
The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.	1
Let's open up a bright future with this ball.	3
Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)	
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?	
I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.	-1
All that I care is that.he's an excellent trainer.	
I can tell that he's a very digilight person that always tries his best.	3
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.	
So, this is how the revelation begins!	-1
Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...	3
Let's contact her and return this.	1
Black Tortoise	
This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?	
Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.	3
I heard that the bath products on Earth are the best in the universe.	
I'm going to check out the new comic issues. Wanna come along?	
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.	
Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!	3
You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.	
I knew this day would come.	
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.	
My teammates and their flawless play!	1
My friends from previous life... They would be pleased to see me win.	-1
My fans!	3
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise says that the Swirlies are missing.	
They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.	-1
They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.	3
I evolved them.	1
Black Tortoise	
You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!	
Cool! Awesome!	1
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	
...Uh...So no soccer?	
Black Tortoise	
This was the worst game in your entire life...Black Tortoise comes to you to cheer you up.	
Please explain why you kicked the ball into our goal post, will you?	
Thanks...I know you're the one that's the most devastated...Let's do better next time.	
Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.	3
Black Tortoise	
Black Tortoise is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.	
Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.	3
Well, having a good ace skill is a start.	
Flawless skills.	
Black Tortoise	
The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.	
I can't stand this...I need to end this quickly and go take a shower.	
What a depressing weather...	
Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!	3
Magnus	
A big fight broke out between an angel and a demon within the team. Magnus is asking for help.	
I'm going to pick sides of the one I like.	3
I hope the demon didn't say anything stupid.	
Maybe the angel said something irritating again.	
Magnus	
Magnus is thinking about what Selena said about saving the galaxy if we win the Galaxy League.	
Then we should do our very best to win.	-1
I can play along if there's something in it for me.	
It's not good to just believe what others say.	
Magnus	
Magnus is spreading the happy news about his cousin having a baby. Let's congratulate him.	
Congratulations!	
So, the numerous baby clothes you've been making were all for this day?	3
I hope that baby comes to be a great soccer player, just like you.	-1
Magnus	
Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?	
We will confront them fair and square, and win.	
I'll go blow up their lodging.	
Pathetic. We'll show them that we're better in many ways.	3
Magnus	
You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.	
How can I earn gold? Where do I have to go to find the REAL Underground?	
It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.	3
So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.	-1
Magnus	
A teammate that is a former member of the Dark Sisters is down sick, suffering from the aftermath of performing exorcism. Let's talk with Magnus about what to do.	
Let's go visit her. Some fun won't do any harm. It might even cheer her up!	3
Let's leave her alone. She may find all this attention uncomfortable.	
Let's be prepared to take care of her in case her sickness gets worse.	
Magnus	
Magnus says to you that it was an honor to be able to play with you. Let's give him an answer.	
Let's do our best until the very end.	
I never imagined that I'd be used like this.	
I'm starting to enjoy playing with you.	3
Magnus	
Magnus looks disappointed about the size of the Galaxy League. What would be an appropriate response?	
Nervous? Trust me. I got you.	3
What were yo uexpecting? An intergalactic war?	-1
Isn't it awesome to see the galaxy come together for soccer?	1
Magnus	
Mortor and Wizol of the Peacemakers are helping an old man. Magnus seems to be surprised.	
Well, what do you know! They have some decency in them after all.	-1
Hmmm.	
It's good to know that they're not shallow people.	3
Magnus	
The team is at Metro City. Magnus seems to be surprised how the people of Metro City have mechanical bodies.	
I like how they don't mind physical flaws.	1
I like how even the minority can be saved in this society	1
You have a heart of gold.	3
Magnus	
Magnus is angry because he was criticized by his performance and is asking your opinion. Let's give him an answer.	
I want to practice with you, if that's okay with you. No?	-1
I admit it. you're the best in the team.	1
I'm sure the lesson here is that all of us need to learn.	-1
Magnus	
The teammates are speaking highly of Magnus, saying he's a good role model. Let's add in.	
Thank you for doing whatever it takes to win.	
He shows dominance with elegance.	3
He's truly a role model to us all with his skills and attitude.	
Magnus	
The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?	
A square match is what suites a proud royalty.	3
Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?	
That has nothing to do with us.	
Magnus	
Magnus is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.	
If you're better than your teammates, you should be the one to be considerate.	3
I'm nt comfortable with this conversation.	
He can be irritating	
Magnus	
Magnus is asking you if you ever saw the World Tree. Let's tell him your thoughts.	
Let's not talk about anything irrelevent to the match.	3
It's something I'd want to see again with a person I care.	-1
It's nothing but a tree.	1
Magnus	
Magnus is thinking about what the Universe of Oblivion is.	
Don't be scared about such petty things.	3
I don't like the word oblivion.	
I don't care as long as it doesn't harm me.	-1
Magnus	
Magnus is talking about how famous his rivals are in the Galaxy League. He seems jealous. Let's talk to him.	
You're as good as they are, I'd say you deserve more credit.	1
Good rivalry brings both sides to higher levels.	1
I'll be your rival from now.	
Magnus	
Magnus, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal what your agenda really is. What should we say?	
To become the strongest being in space! I shall tramp on everything that stands in my path!	1
Just playing soccer, that's all.	3
To bring justice with soccer. That's all.	-1
Magnus	
Let's talk to Magnus who recently started to take interest in the world of angels.	
It's a place to rest for the good.	-1
I'm sure it'd be full of hypocrites.	
I hope it's not a boring place.	3
Magnus	
You're having a conversation with Magnus about the power of Spirit Stones which is covered in secrets. Let's tell him what you think.	
I need a Spirit Stone that's as fancy as I am.	3
I won't rely on Spirit Stones.	
I would buy them all if I could.	
Magnus	
Magnus seems to be uncomfortable to hear about the love life of other teammates. Let's talk to him.	
It's all good as long as it doesn't affect the match.	
Should we join the club?	3
Just say it. You're jealous.	
Magnus	
It's a tough match, but Magnus is standing tall and encouraging the team. What should we say to him?	
You really help us a lot in these situations.	
You're a good person.	
Your spirit is an inspiration to us all.	3
Magnus	
Cracsus threatens to hack Magnus's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?	
Let's blackmail Robin that we'll pluck out of his plants.	
I contacted Hildegard.	-1
Don't fall for this cheap shot.	1
Magnus	
Magnus is furious about how Lucian is always surrounded by girls. What should we say?	
Are you jealous?	3
He's popular, just not as much as me.	
He's good looking and has a good personality. Maybe that's why.	
Magnus	
Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Magnus wants to say a word.	
Get yourselves together, guys. Are you going to give up already?	3
Come on guys, you know it's an exciting thing to be playing against a strong team! Keep your heads up high!	
They will be sacrificed for our victory and honor.	
Magnus	
You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?	
I feel sorry, but that's irrelevant to the match.	
This is going to be a cake walk.	
I'm considering making an anonymous donation.	3
Magnus	
You come across Magnus, who was overwhelmed by his opponent throughout the game. Let's cheer him up.	
Those scumbags played dirty. Ugh, I'm angry!	
I should step on that player's foot next time.	
I'm proud that you played your game and didn't descend to the opponent's level.	3
Magnus	
Magnus is asking you what you think is it that makes this team great. You weren't expecting this, but you should give him an answer.	
We have a strong lineup of players that make our star players shine brighter	-1
Well, you're looking at the one person that is making this team great.	
You. I know you're doing much for the team without taking any credit.	3
Magnus	
Magnus wants to have an academic conversation about the 5th dimension, string theory, and other infamously hard space theories. Why...?	
(He wants you to be a good listener.)	1
(There must be a reason why he started this conversation.)	1
(Maybe he brought snacks but is too shy to share it with me.)	
Magnus	
The team seems very nervous facing Skalardra. What should we do?	
Hmm? What's wrong everybody?	
Political power means nothing on the field.	
Huh? I think Magnus is prettier.	3
Magnus	
Magnus is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''	
Not again...	
Let's do this! I'm at your disposal!	3
I like what you just said.	1
Magnus	
Kirin suddenly appears, pats Magnus on the head while teasing him, and then goes away. Magnus seems angry...	
He's like the wind. There wasn't even time to chat.	
...I think you liked it more than you thought...	3
Patting you on the head? He must not fear for his life!	1
Miho	
Miho is furious about how Lucian is always surrounded by girls. What should we say?	
Are you jealous?	3
He's popular, just not as much as me.	
He's good looking and has a good personality. Maybe that's why.	
Miho	
It's a tough match, but Miho is standing tall and encouraging the team. What should we say to her?	
You really help us a lot in these situations.	
You're a good person.	
Your spirit is an inspiration to us all.	3
Miho	
Miho is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?	
That doesn't change what we must do.	3
Come on, cheer up. You're not being yourself.	1
Stop whining, I like it better when you're arrogant and sarcastic.	
Miho	
You find Miho lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?	
Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?	3
Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!	
Hmm, I guess you're more domestic than I thought.	1
Miho	
Miho seems to be interested in the Micrinum from Kiri, which is said to be good for beauty and anti-aging. Let's talk to her.	
I think that's a good choice.	
Looks aren't important when it comes to soccer.	
You're young and good looking even without that.	3
Miho	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Miho some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	
Make him know who he's up against.	-1
Let's try out some forward passes.	3
Miho	
Kirin suddenly appears, pats Miho on the head while teasing her, and then goes away. Miho seems angry...	
He's like the wind. There wasn't even time to chat.	1
...I think you liked it more than you thought...	
Patting you on the head? He must not fear for his life!	1
Miho	
The team seems very nervous facing Skalardra. What should we do?	
Hmm? What's wrong everybody?	
Political power means nothing on the field.	
Huh? I think Miho is prettier.	3
Miho	
Miho, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.	
It was an intense feeling as if I was going against the strongest team in the universe.	1
I've never dreamt about soccer.	
I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.	-1
Miho	
Miho wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.	
I'm surprised you care so much for your friends.	-1
Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.	
It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.	
Miho	
Miho seems to be determined to crush the opposing team. Let's give her some advice.	
That's the spirit! Let's teach them a lesson!	3
With your skills and dedication, I have no doubt that you will.	
I like how you're doing your best.	
Miho	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	3
Stop right there, pig!	
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	
Miho	
Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Miho seems to be sick of this.	
Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Miho!	1
Iron Claw!	
Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)	3
Miho	
Miho says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.	
I think you two have something in common...	
Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.	3
Hmm? That is odd...What do you think about this?	
Miho	
Kuma is furiously chasing Ogre. Miho seems confused.	
Two bears...Which one is Kuma?	
Well, one thing is for sure. One of them did something stupid.	1
Looks like Orge is goofing around. I mean the guy has like over 200 pounds over Kuma.	
Miho	
You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Miho seems to be worried.	
Weakling, Should've been rougher on that player.	
It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.	
Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.	1
Miho	
Miho is angry because she was criticized by her performance and is asking your opinion. Let's give her an answer.	
I want to practice with you, if that's okay with you. No? 	3
I admit it. you're the best in the team. 	
I'm sure the lessin here is that all of us need to learn. 	
Evylin	
After a meeting, Evylin's eyes met yours a several times and Evylin asks if she has something on her face.	
Yeah, Kuma's hat...	
I was just thinking the team became stronger,thanks to you.	1
I was just thinking about how much you do for the team.	3
Evylin	
Evylin is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.	
I'm sure there were multiple reasons on why the kingdom fell. It's sad to hear such stories.	
So, is that king entering the Galaxy League?	
Pathetic...That is no king.	1
Evylin	
You come across Sammy while walking the street with Evylin. Let's talk to her.	
We'll win next time!	
Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.	3
(Ignore.)	
Evylin	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Evylin asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "i feel like I can fly" or something?	
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	1
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	
Evylin	
It's Evylin's birthday. Let's give her a present.	
Here! I made some cookie with the team.	3
I stole this treasure box from Kuma.	
This is a championship trophy replica for you. The design are inspired by you.	
Evylin	
A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Evylin.	
I feel like he's mocking us!	
It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keep ramping up	3
He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.	1
Evylin	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Evylin having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match.	
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?	3
...I see two idiots standing in front of me...	
Evylin	
Evylin is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.	
The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.	
I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!	1
I am so thankful to them.	3
Evylin	
Evylin is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.	
He's just material for leveling up	
I like how all of the Gate Keepers have different characteristics	
That bear... Is a hero...!	-1
Evylin	
Evylin is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.	
I hope this won't affect your performance in the field.	
The fans love your performance!	
Should've practiced the autograph like I told you.	3
Evylin	
The team will not have a match for some time. Evylin asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.	-1
Hmmm, wanna go shopping?	
I have a very hard training session all planed up for everybody.	
	
Silk	
The team is at Metro City. Silk seems to be surprised how the people of Metro City have mechanical bodies.	
I like how they don't mind physical flaws.	
I like how even the minority can be saved in this society.	3
You have a heart of gold.	
Silk	
Silk is furious about how Lucian is always surrounded by girls. What should we say?	
Are you jealous?	
He's popular, just not as much as me.	
He's good looking and has a good personality. Maybe that's why.	3
Silk	
Silk is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.	
Do you think they'll be tasty?	
I think they're cute and elegant if you leave out the pig and the bear.	
I'd like to keep one as a pet.	3
Silk	
Silk looks disappointed about the size of the Galaxy League. What would be an appropriate response?	
Nervous? Trust me, I got you.	1
What were you expecting? An intergalatic war?	-1
Isn't it awesome to see the galaxy come together for soccer?	3
Silk	
Silk seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.	
Be careful not to be stomped on...	
We can do this! Let's go!	3
Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?	-1
Silk	
Silk says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.	
Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.	
That's strange. I thought he was more of an authoritative character.	
Yeah, they get along pretty well.	3
Silk	
Silk asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give her a sincere answer.	
I guess I'll be chasing you on the road of glory.	
I want to see everybody smile.  I think that'll make me happy.	3
I'm going to make a joke before I start crying!	
Silk	
Silk is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.	
Life is a light of its own.	3
That's deep. I think it's cool.	
How about we make it to the top of the Galaxy League and shine the universe with the light within us?	1
Silk	
Silk seems to be uncomfortable to hear about the love life of other teammates. Let's talk to her.	
It's all good as long as it doesn't affect the match.	
Should we join the club?	-1
Just say it. You're jealous.	-1
Silk	
Silk is asking you what you think is it that makes this team great. You weren't expecting this, but you should give her an answer.	
We have a strong lineup of players that make our star players shine brighter.	-1
Well, you're looking at the one person that is making this team great.	3
You. I know you're doing much for the team without taking any credit.	1
Silk	
Silk refuses to listen to anybody's advice saying he's the best and he doesn't need any advice. Let's talk to her.	
Are you angry because I wasn't there to oversee your training? I said I'm sorry!	
Well that's absolutely fine if you can actually prove that you're the best.	1
That's not like you...	3
Silk	
Silk is angry because she was criticized by her performance and is asking your opinion. Let's give her an answer.	
I want to practice with you, if that's okay with you. No?	1
I admit it. You're the best in the team.	
I'm sure the lesson here is that all of us need to learn.	3
Silk	
Silk is spreading the happy news about her cousin having a baby. Let's congratulate her.	
Congratulations!	3
So, the numerous baby clothes you've been making were all for this day?	
I hope that baby comes to be a great soccer player, just like you.	1
Silk	
Silk is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?	
I don't think you need to worry about a diet.	1
You're playing soccer! You're fine!	3
Please don't forget about the match.	
Silk	
Silk says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.	
it'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry.	1
Did she think that you'll take over the throne?	-1
I sense that there's something she hasn't told us yet...	3
Silk	
Silk went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?	
We should think about how to make fun of her when she comes back.	
I feel sorry for the other team.	
Silk is in danger! We have to save her!	3
Silk	
Silk seems to be determined to crush the opposing team. Let's give her some advice.	
That's the spirit! Let's teach them a lesson!	
With your skills and dedication, I have no doubt that you will.	-1
I like how you're doing your best.	3
Silk	
Silk seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?	
Congradulations! How did you guys get along?	
Don't forget that we exist! Haha!	1
Good for you! I know it's hard for you to find someone at your level!	
Silk	
Silk seems to be interested in the Micrinum from Kiri, which is said to be good for beauty and anti-aging. Let's talk to her.	
I think that's a good choice.	
Looks aren't important when it comes to soccer.	3
You're young good looking even without that.	
Silk	
Silk wants to have an academic conversation about the 5th dimension, string theory, and other infamously hard space theories. Why...?	
(She wants you to be a good listener.)	-1
There must be a reason why she started this conversation.)	3
Maybe she brought snacks but is too shy to share it with me.)	-1
Silk	
Silk wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.	
Beginner level monsters in an RPG game.	
Thankful beings that will be our +160.	-1
I'm planning to make a whole line of merchandise with them as the character.	
Silk	
Silk claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?	
She must've made a mistake.	3
Maybe Sohpie is actually a male...?	1
I don't care what the case is.	
Silk	
Silk looks sad because she feels her friendship with a friend in a rival team is falling apart. What should we say to her?	
It's not your fault. Let's try to find out why this is happening.	3
Try starting off with some small talk.	
If your friend is truly your friend, she will understand.	1
Silk	
Silk is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle.	
You seem like the princess...Scratch that, the queen.	
She seems like a nice girl.	3
It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.	1
Silk	
Silk says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.	
Tell them they should remember that they play for you.	
Just hear them out and smile.They'll feel better.	
You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous.Just don't go too sarcastic on them	1
Silk	
Silk says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.	
They're young but they have passion.	
Yeah,I mean they could get hurt.	
Teach them how adults play soccer.	-1
Silk	
Silk, who has shown absolutely superb chemistry with you, is embarrassed and says she didn't do all of that because of you. What should we say?	
Stop being embarrassed and just accept the compliments, will you?	3
Yeah? Well, I did what I did for you.	
I know.	
Silk	
Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Silk seems to be troubled. What should we do?	
If you guys keep giving Silk trouble, I swear to god I'll use both as special training material.	3
If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?	
You both need to be disciplined by Silk.	-1
Silk	
Silk is talking about how famous her rivals are in the Galaxy League. She seems jealous. Let's talk to her.	
You're as good as they are, I'd say you desrve more credit.	
Good rivalry brings both sides to higher levels.	3
I'll be your rival from now.	
Silk	
Silk says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?	
Of course! Everybody is counting on you!	3
Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.	
I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.	1
Silk	
You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Silk hands you a present.	
(A cute and pretty pendant)	3
(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)	
(A chocker with a pretty radical design.)	
Silk	
Kuma is furiously chasing Ogre. Silk seems confused.	
Two bears...Which one is Kuma?	-1
Well, one thing is for sure. One of them did something stupid.	-1
Looks like Orge is goofing around. I mean the guy has like over 200 pounds over Kuma.	
Silk	
Silk is interested in Selena and is asking for your opinion. What should we say?	
She's kind and sweet. Maybe you'll have a shot?	3
Be honest and show a sincere attitude.	
Considering your personality, I think she'll accept you.	-1
Silk	
Silk says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.	
That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy and love.	-1
I think she likes him.	
Maybe she's up to something.	-1
	
Princess Meiran	
The match and the concert that Princess Meiran was looking for start at the same time...	
Let's hack the big screen so we can see the concert!	1
Channel that sorrow and rage towards your opponents and make them pay.	
I'm sorry that you couldn't go.	
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran won a trip around the world from a radio event!	
What about soccer? You'll have to go through me to go on that trip	
Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.	3
...World? What about space? Isn't that more interesting?	
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to her.	
Everybody should grow up.	
It'll be alright. Don't worry.	-1
Le's go look for her. 	
Princess Meiran	
MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.	
Stop right there!	
Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?	3
...Maybe he just likes cats!	
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran is having trouble deciding a name for her special move. Her options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.	
I'm sure you're going to become an intergalactic fool.	3
I...Respect your naming taste...	-1
Cool! Keep it up!	
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to her.	
It's silly of you to worry about such things. Are you feeling okay?	
We must have faith in the Gate Keeper and win the Galaxy League.	3
A mysterious villain... Bad taste, if you ask me.	
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.	
Let's all talk together and figure out what problem is.	3
Let's invest some Crystals and get new players!	
We may have to go rough on the team and make them realize the problem.	
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?	
It's within our grasp.	3
I would like to hear what you think is the best team in the universe.	1
Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.	-1
Princess Meiran	
You're talking to Princess Meiran about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow. Let's tell her your answer.	
I would say goodbye to all my friends.	3
If it's the end of the world, I'd pull of a crazy performance in a densely populated area before I go!	-1
Hmm, there's a guy I'd like to beat up before I die.	1
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.	
This needs to be analyzed and fixed.  Can you help me?	3
Passes that you prefer aren't always the right answer.	1
It can't be perfect every time.	
Princess Meiran	
You forgot to lock Princess Meiran and almost used her as training material! She looks very upset!	
It's my fault	3
It was all just to motivate you to become a better player!	
It's your fault.	
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...	
I have very specific standards for personality, looks, values, and background. Are you interested in hearing about it?	1
I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.	-1
I think that being able to understand each other is the most important.	3
Princess Meiran	
This was the worst game in your entire life...Princess Meiran comes to you to cheer you up.	
Please explain why you kicked the ball into our goal post, will you?	
Thanks...I know you're the one that's the most devastated...Let's do better next time.	
Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.	3
Princess Meiran	
You're sick and in bed when Princess Meiran and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?	
You guys... I'm about to cry...	
I'm sorry... I should be giving you guys tea or something, but...	3
Get closer so I can spread my germs!	
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?	
First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.	3
Of course we should tell Lynbell! What are you waiting for?	
...Sometimes, the truth is better to be left a secret.	-1
Princess Meiran	
According to Princess Meiran's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.	
I want to see Tyler's true characteristics.	1
William doesn't know how to respect his seniors.	-1
I thought they were just friends.	
Princess Meiran	
There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?	
What's done is done. Let's come up with a new design.	1
It's finally time for some festival-soccer!	-1
Let's split up and find the uniforms.	
Princess Meiran	
The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.	
Let's see what you have to say after the match.	3
I didn't know I was a talented foot volleyball player!	
Care to receive the ball with your face?	
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to her?	
How about we play baseball today?	-1
No, it's not boring.	3
If you're up for suggestions, I'm all ears.	1
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?	
(I want everyday to be exciting and fun.)	
(I don't want to waste a single day in my life.)	3
(I want my dreams to come true.)	-1
Princess Meiran	
With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Princess Meiran for solutions.	
We won't be able to win league if we fail to overcome this. 	1
I guess its time the benchwarmers get a chance. 	3
How about we put that advanced technology of Metro City to use?	
Princess Meiran	
On a day off, Princess Meiran is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.	
I´d love to have a stable job first.	
It´s really hard to find the right person.	1
If you find a handsome man, try talking to him!	1
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.	
I would've tried to find something that fits me.	
Something full of excitement!	
I would've been doing something to save the universe.	3
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell her?	
To win all the way, of course.	-1
Best of 4 should be our goal.	3
Teamwork is what matters the most.	
Princess Meiran	
It's before the 2nd half, and Princess Meiran is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.	
We should at least put up a fight so they remember us.	
There's nothing we can really do. Let's just get this over with.	
Don't give up until the end.	3
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.	
What's the agenda here? Are you trying to taint the pure angels?	
This is a good chance to show the baby angels how rough soccer can be!	-1
That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.	3
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop her from causing any problems.	
You're right. This is a waste of time.	
The honor of our opponent is also important.	3
That team is far from your style.	1
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.	
I hope you get scouted by an interesting team.	1
Make the scouters fall in love with your performance.	1
Let's make that our goal and make it happen.	
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran is making a scene. She'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.	
Vicious? More like ugly.	
The door's over there.	-1
Are you giving up before putting up a fight?	3
Princess Meiran	
The team manger ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?	
We could start a reset marathon.	
We're going to hunt that manager down and take back our money. We will show no mercy!	-1
Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.	3
Princess Meiran	
You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Princess Meiran and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.	
Let's give her some space.	3
I could really use some grilled sweet potatoes and chestnuts.	
There's no time for tears! Find out who did this and bring justice!	-1
Princess Meiran	
Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some advice.	
Is winning really worth going that far?	1
I don't see anything wrong as long as you can get away with it.	-1
Be true to yourself.	
Princess Meiran	
The match started and Princess Meiran is standing still doing nothing.	
What is she doing?  Is she a totem?	
Run!  Just start running!	-1
Looks like we'll have to do without her.	3
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran is looking excited and asks how the match went.	
The other team went home crying!	
They were a worthy opponent.	3
I led our team to victory with wedgies!	
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.	
It's only a sport! The strongest team wins, and we are strong!	1
I'm sure everyboby is feeling the same way you feel.	
Aren't you the one everyboby should be afraid of?	
Princess Meiran	
The team is saying bad things about Princess Meiran for skipping practice. Time to intervene.	
Do you really think that she would skip practice?	3
Skipping practice isn't something that's in her dictionary.	1
Her love towards soccer is real.	
Princess Meiran	
Princess Meiran wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.	
Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.	3
The character story left him a trauma.	
Maybe he just wants to duke it out.	
	
Vivid Fear	
Mortor and Wizol of the Peacemakers are helping an old man. Vivid Fear seems to be surprised.	
Well, what do you know! They have some decency in them after all.	
Hmmm.	1
It's good to know that they're not shallow people.	3
Vivid Fear	
It's a very intense match and Vivid Fear falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Vivid Fear up and the two exchange smiles.	
Guess the match isn't tough for you, huh?	
True sportsmanship! Wonderful!	-1
That player must have a heart of gold.	
Vivid Fear	
Cracsus threatens to hack Vivid Fear's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?	
Let's blackmail Robin that we;ll pluck out all of his plants.	-1
I contacted Hildegard.	-1
Don't fall for this cheap shot.	
Vivid Fear	
The team will not have a match for some time. Vivid Fear asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.	1
Hmm, wanna go shopping?	
I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody	3
Vivid Fear	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Vivid Fear asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel like I can fly" or something?	3
This is where things get serious. We're going to win!	1
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	-1
Vivid Fear	
Vivid Fear is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.	
The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.	3
I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!	
I am so thankful to them.	-1
Vivid Fear	
A big fight broke out between an angel and a demon within the team. Vivid Fear is asking for help.	
I'm going to pick sides of the one I like.	3
I hope the demon didn't say anything stupid.	
Maybe the angel did something irritating again.	1
Vivid Fear	
The teammates are speaking highly of Vivid Fear, saying she's a good role model. Let's add in.	
Thank you for doing whatever it takes to win.	
She shows dominance with elegance.	3
She's truly a role model to us all with her skills and attitude.	
Vivid Fear	
A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Vivid Fear.	
I feel like he's mocking us!	1
It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.	-1
He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.	3
Vivid Fear	
You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?	
I feel sorry, but that's irrelevant to the match.	
This is going to be a cake walk.	
I'm considering making an anonymous donation.	3
Vivid Fear	
Vivid Fear brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...	
Throw it away. NOW.	3
Drink it up!	
Vivid Fear	
Vivid Fear, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal who you really are. What should we answer?	
To become the strongest being in space! I shall tramp on everything that stands in my path!	1
Just playing soccer, that's all.	3
To bring justice with soccer. That's all.	
Vivid Fear	
Vivid Fear lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good... Can anybody give him some heals?	
Well, this could all have been prevented if you consumed those Swirlies like I told you...	3
I will avenge you!	
Vivid Fear	
Vivid Fear is asking you if you ever saw the World Tree. Let's tell her your thoughts.	
Let's not talk about anything irrelevant to the match.	
It's something I'd want to see again with a person i care.	-1
It's nothing but a tree.	
Vivid Fear	
Vivid Fear points out that the time the men of Minerva died and the time the epidemic broke out in Metro City matches.	
I think that had something to do with dirty money.	
It would disgust me if that was the result of an evil plot.	3
That's too convenient it be a coincidence.	
Vivid Fear	
You come across Vivid Fear, who was overwhelmed by her opponent throughout the game. Let's cheer her up.	
Those scumbags played dirty. Ugh, I'm angry!	
I should step on the player's foot next time. 	-1
I'm proud that you played your game and didn't descend to the opponents level.	3
Vivid Fear	
Vivid Fear falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?	
If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.	
Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!	-1
Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.	-1
Vivid Fear	
Vivid Fear suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.	
How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.	3
Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!	-1
Vivid Fear	
You come across Sammy while walking the street with Vivid Fear. Let's talk to her.	
We'll win next time!	
Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.	
(Ignore.)	3
Vivid Fear	
As Vivid Fear said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	3
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	1
Vivid Fear	
Vivid Fear is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.	
If you're better than your teammates, you should be the on to be considerate.	3
I'm not comfortable with this conversation.	
He can be irritating.	1
Vivid Fear	
Vivid Fear is thinking about what Selena said about saving the galaxy if we win the Galaxy League.	
Then we should do our very best to win.	-1
I can play along if there's something in it for me.	
It's not good to just believe what others say.	
Vivid Fear	
Vivid Fear is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''	
Not again...	
Let's do this! I'm at your disposal!	3
I like what you just said	
Vivid Fear	
Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?	
We will confront them fair and square, and win.	
I'll go blow up their lodging.	
Pathetic. We'll show them that we're better in many ways.	3
Vivid Fear	
The crowd is cheering for Vivid Fear. Vivid Fear seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.	
They're all in love with your enthusiatic play.	1
They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.	
How about just accepting the compliments for today?	
Vivid Fear	
Vivid Fear scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!	
Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we score the first goal?	
That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!	
You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!	-1
Vivid Fear	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Vivid Fear having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match.	-1
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?	
...I see two idiots standing in front of me...	
Vivid Fear	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	3
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	
Vivid Fear	
Vivid Fear was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.	
Oh, that'll be so cute!	
It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!	3
We can play soccer with the penguins!	
Vivid Fear	
Vivid Fear says to you that it was an honor to be able to play with you. Let's give her an answer.	
Let's do our best until the very end!	
I never imagined that i'd be used like this.	
I'm starting to enjoy playing with you.	3
Vivid Fear	
You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.	
How can I earn gold? Where do I have to go to find the REAL Underground?	-1
It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.	
So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.	-1
Vivid Fear	
Vivid Fear is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.	
I hope this won't affect your performance in the field.	3
The fans love your performance!	
Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.	
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.	
That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy and love.	3
I think she likes him.	-1
Maybe she's up to something.	-1
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?	
She must've made a mistake.	1
Maybe Sophie is actually a male..?	1
I don't care what the case is.	
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?	
We should think about how to make fun of her when she comes back.	
I feel sorry for the other team.	
Elizabeth is in danger! We have to save her!	-1
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.	
Tell them they should remember that they play for you.	3
Just hear them out and smile. They'll feel better.	1
You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.	-1
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?	
Of course! Everybody is counting on you!	
Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.	
I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.	3
Elizabeth	
You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.	
...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...	3
Ugh...I want to dig my eyes out.	
Fontus...You sure are my archnemesis!	
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.	
Beginner level monsters in an RPG game.	
Thankful beings that will be our +160.	3
I'm planning to make a whole line of merchandise with them as the character	
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?	
Perfect planning and perfect execution	1
All goes as planned....Hmm? Just ignore that.	
Why don't you join them and find out?	3
Elizabeth	
It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?	
I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.	
I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.	
Wow, congratulations! (Claps)	3
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.	
Be careful not to be stomped on...	3
We can do this! Let's go!	-1
Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?	-1
Elizabeth	
The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.	
I can't stand this...I need to end this quickly and go take a shower.	
What a depressing weather...	
Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!	3
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.	
Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!	3
You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.	
I knew this day would come.	
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?	
Congratulations! How did you guys get along?	-1
Don't forget that we exist! Haha!	
Good for you! I know it's hard for you to find someone at your level!	3
Elizabeth	
Ogre's pony tail slapped Elizabeth in the face!	
Even his hair is a weapon! Is that even allowed? 	
That must hurt.	3
Ugh...Gross...	1
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.	
Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.	
That's strange. I thought he was more of an authoratative character.	3
Yeah, they get along pretty well.	1
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.	
They're young but they have passion.	3
Yeah, I mean they could get hurt.	
Teach them how adults play soccer.	
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth says she's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.	
Is her name really Kiki?	
Ask her if she likes you and if she wants to join our team.	3
Tell her to be our lap cat.	
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.	
Life is a light of its own.	1
That's deep. I think it's cool.	
How about we make it to the top of the Galaxy League and shine the universe with the light within us?	3
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.	
My teammates and their flawless play!	1
My friends from previous life... They would be pleased to see me win.	-1
My fans!	
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.	
So, this is how the revelation begins!	
Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...	3
Let's contact her and return this.	
Elizabeth	
This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?	
Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.	3
I heard that the bath products on Earth are the best in the universe.	
I'm going to check out the new comic issues. Wanna come along?	
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?	
Where do you think those comets are going?	
Do you think any of those comets are populated?	
The space has prepared this beautiful stage for you.	3
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?	
I don't think you need to worry about a diet.	3
You're playing soccer! You're fine!	-1
Please don't forget about the match.	
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle.	
You seem like the princess... Scratch that, the queen.	3
She seems like a nice girl.	1
It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.	
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.	
This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!	1
Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!	3
How about some presents for your parents	
Elizabeth	
Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.	
Well, now what?	1
Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?	-1
A crow?!	3
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?	
It's the place where the chosen ones learn about their destiny.	-1
It's the place of dreams colliding.	3
It's stressful because we can't prepare for extraterrestrial sanitation. We're completely exposing to all those unknown...things.	
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth says that the Swirlies are missing.	
They were sacrificed as materials for a greater cause.	
They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.	3
I evolved them.	
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.	
Do you think they'll be tasty?	
I think they're cute and elegant if you leave out the pig and the bear.	3
I'd like to keep one as a pet.	
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.	
Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!	3
Life,eh? I guess that's a bit too serious for me, but I think I understand how you feel.	1
And that's how we walk towards our destiny.	
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.	
Hmmm, a revived person that forgot his purpose... Reminds me of somebody.	-1
He'll remember someday.	3
That's bad. I'm sure it's something important!	
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.	
It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.	3
Do I have to stop the match?	
It's time, Elizabeth! Awaken the 6th attribute and show your true powers!	-1
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.	
That's because you haven't opened up your "third eye"!	
Isn't that the same with all other Beastmen?	3
Hmm, her tail is a bit weird and her ears are definitely human...	1
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?	
I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.	3
The eyepatch...Iwonder if she washes it. She seems to have it on at all time.	
That's a dangeroius secret you're trying to find out about. Do you still want to know?	
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.	
it'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry.	
Did she think that you'll take over the throne?	3
I sense that there's something she hasn't told us yet...	-1
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.	
Everybody is not at 100%.But,i think we'll do better sooner or later.	3
It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy!This is nonsense!	
We haven't awakened our TRUE powers!We have to go further beyond!	
Elizabeth	
Elizabeth says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?	
That's unacceptable!	
You can only find your true potential when you don't rely on your skills!	
Well, we can't do anyting about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.	3
	
Shanti	
Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Shanti seems to be sick of this.	
Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Shanti!	3
Iron Claw!	
Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)	
Shanti	
You find Shanti depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.	
Don't mind it. It's our fault. We were'nt able to make use of your strength.	
You did well and I thank you for that.	3
It's not your fault that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!	-1
Shanti	
Shanti is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?	
You can overcome this like always. Right?	3
It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponent off guard.	-1
Let's solve the problems one by one.	
Shanti	
A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Shanti. What should you say?	
Well, Shanti does have that kind of charm.	3
Well, you're as cute as Shanti.	
I hope you two become good friends.	3
Shanti	
Shanti says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.	
I think you two have something in common...	-1
Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.	
Hmm? That is odd...What do you think about this?	3
Shanti	
It seems that Shanti is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?	
Listen carefully and you'll find her.	3
Let's ask Khirel to find her...	
Shanti? Nah, she never gets lost.	
Shanti	
Shanti came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.	
What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?	3
I'm sure you got scammed.	
I hope that wasn't all you got.	
Shanti	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	1
Stop right there, pig!	3
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	
Shanti	
Shanti looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.	
Did you prepare your meds in case you get space sick? Nvr mind, I'll prepare the meds.	-1
Don't worry. Leave it up to me.	
Littre will be fine.	
Shanti	
Shanti, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.	
It was an intense feeling as if I was going against the strongest team in the universe.	1
I've never dreamt about soccer.	
I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.	3
Shanti	
Shanti seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.	
It's thanks to you!  Thanks for listening to my instructions.	1
I'm starting to see true strength in this team.	3
Perfect! No mistakes made!	-1
Shanti	
The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Shanti and her opponent isn't over yet.	
You better win that fight!	3
Hey! The match is over!	
I've never seen her worked up that much	
Shanti	
Latios is chatting with Shanti after the match. Let's barge in.	
Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's our pretty girl.	-1
Shanti was fantastic on the field, right?	
I'm looking forward to our next match!	3
Shanti	
Shanti is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?	
That doesn't change what we must do.	
Come on, cheer up. You're not being yourself.	3
Stop whining. I like it better when you're arrogant and sarcastic.	
Shanti	
Shanti's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Shanti seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.	
That player is just messing with you.	3

You're doing fine. Don't play your opponent's game.	1
Shanti	
Shanti wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?

Sure. Let's beat them all and take the prize money!	1
Shanti	
The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Shanti do?

(Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.)	
Shanti	
Shanti caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?	
I think we should hang him.	
Why didn't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing,	1
You came to see my marvelopus moves? I'm flattered.	3
Shanti	
James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.

Shanti	
A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?

Shanti	
Shanti wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.

It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.	3
Shanti	
Shanti is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.	
I'm afraid to be honest.	
I was always looking forward for that moment.	3
Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes, will you?	
Shanti	
You come across Shanti who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?	
I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.	
Trust me and your teammates. Sit this one out.	
Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.	3
Shanti	
Shanti is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.	
Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes. You're a precious part of this team.	
Don't be anxious. Have faith and keep following me.	
That's why I need your help.	3
Shanti	
Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Shanti.	
I think he felt better because of the positive energy you always have around you.	1
Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?	
You saved us all from awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.	
Shanti	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	
Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.	
Let's give them a hand.	3
Shanti	
You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Shanti seems to be worried.	
Weakling. Should have been rougher on that player.	
It's unfortunate, but thats's something that happaned during a match and it's not out fault.	
Let's just go, That player will also feel uncomfortable of we keep standing here.	3
Shanti	
You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.	
Can't you cook ramen by yourself?	3
Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.	-1
Is Marilyn your mother or nanny?	
Shanti	
Shanti is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?	
We'll find the ones that did this and use them as fertilizers	-1
It's a big tree. It'll stand strong	1
Who could've done such a hideous thing?	
Shanti	
Shanti looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.	
It's space. Anything can exist here.	
How about we ask Jeunese?	
Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.	1
Shanti

I have faith in you.	
Shanti	
Shanti is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.	
We need a decent level of personal performance.	-1
What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?	
Wreck the other team.	
Shanti	
Shanti is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.	
I'll sleep by your side tonight.	-1
I see. We must be careful. I'll be watching over you.	-1
It's just a dream. Forget about it.	
	
Linmay	
Linmay looks sad because she feels her friendship with a friend in a rival team is falling apart. What should we say to her?	
It's not your fault. Let's try to find out why this is happening.	-1
Try starting off with some small talk.	3
If your friend is truly your friend, she will understand.	-1
Linmay	
After a meeting, Linmay's eyes met yours a several times and Linmay asks if she has something on her face.	
Yeah, Kuma's hat...	
I was just thinking the team became stronger, thanks to you.	
I was just thinking about how much you do for the team.	3
Linmay	
Linmay is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.	
He's just material for leveling up.	-1
I like how all Gate Keepers have different characteristics.	3
That bear...Is a hero...!	-1
Linmay	
Linmay is talking about how famous her rivals are in the Galaxy League. She seems jealous. Let's talk to her.	
You're as good as they are, I'd say you deserve more credit.	1
Good rivalry brings both sides to higher levels.	1
I'll be your rival from now.	3
Linmay	
Linmay is spreading the happy news about her cousin having a baby. Let's congratulate her.	
Congratulations!	1
So, the numerous clothes you've been making were all for this day?	
I hope that baby comes to be a great soccer player, just like you.	-1
Linmay	
Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Linmay on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?	 is
You and I are already perfect. So I guess that means we shouldn't be saying our names.	1
I can't pick just one...	3
I think it should be you, but will you be able to return to your normal life after all of this is...Wait, I'm going off topic, right?	-1
Linmay	
Kirin suddenly appears, pats Linmay on the head while teasing her, and then goes away. Linmay seems angry...	
He's like the wind. There wasn't even time to chat.	1
...I think you liked it more than you thought...	3
Patting you on the head? He must not fear for his life!	
Linmay	
You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also Linmay's rival, has been severely injured and is in the hospital. What should you say to her?	
Sorry for the bad news. Do you want to pay a visit?	3
This is our chance to steal his precious collection.	
This won't be the end of your rival.	
Linmay	
Kuma is furiously chasing Ogre. Linmay seems confused.	
Two bears... Which one is Kuma?	3
Well, one thing for sure. One of them did something stupid.	1
Looks like Ogre is goofing around. I mean the guy has like over 200 pounds over Kuma.	
Linmay	
Linmay seems to be interested in the Micrinum from Kiri, which is said to be good for beauty and anti-aging. Let's talk to her.	
I think that's a good choice	
Looks aren't important when it comes to soccer	
you're young and good looking even without it	3
Linmay	
Linmay seems to be uncomfortable to hear about the love life of other teammates. Let's talk to her.	
It's all good as long as it doesn't affect the match.	1
Should we join the club?	3
Just say it. You're jealous.	
Linmay	
Linmay is worried that she has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous things. What should we tell her?	
Look at the beautiful players! This is paradise!	
You're the most dangerous of them all.	
Makes it worth the challenge, don't you think so?	3
Linmay	
The team is at Metro City. Linmay seems to be surprised how the people of Metro City have mechanical bodies.	
I like how they don't mind physical flaws.	1
I like how even the minority can be saved in this society.	
You have a heart of gold.	3
Linmay	
A teammate that is a former member of the Dark Sisters is down sick, suffering from the aftermath of performing exorcism. Let's talk with Linmay about what to do.	
Let's go visit her. Some fun won't do any harm. It might even cheer her up!	3
Let's leave her alone. She may find all of this attention uncomfortable.	
Let's be prepared to take care of her in case her sickness gets worse. 	1
Linmay	
You find Linmay being very excited after performing an awesome play. How will you react?	
Can't you do that more often?! (Cries)	
Nice play! Fantastic!	
Now we're starting to look like a team!	3
Linmay	
Linmay is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to her.	
I want you to form a team and catch every single bear near this locker room.	3
...If you want to say something. It's alright. I'll be listening	
Let's go tell the manager	
Linmay	
Linmay comes to you and says that she has to leave the team because of personal reasons. What should we say?	
Well, I don't want to be the one holding you back. Good luck!	
There will always be a place for you to return.	3
So, how does this work? Do I tap "Sell"?	
Linmay	
Linmay is furious about how Lucian is always surrounded by girls. What should we say?	
Are you jealous?	3
He's popular, just not as much as me.	-1
He's good looking and has a good personality. Maybe that's why.	
Linmay	
Linmay doesn't like the new team advertisement video.	
There's not enough fan service.	-1
It didn't portray your awesome performance.	1
It didn't have to have the bench warmers in the video.	3
Linmay	
It's a tough match, but Linmay is standing tall and encouraging the team. What should we say to her?	
You really help us a lot these situations.	-1
You're a good person.	-1
Your spirit is  inspiration to us all.	
Linmay	
Linmay refuses to listen to anybody's advice saying he's the best and he doesn't need any advice. Let's talk to her.	
Are you angry because I wasn't there to oversee your training? I said I'm sorry!	3
Well that's absolutely fine if you can actually prove that you're the best.	1
That's not like you...	
Linmay	
The team seems very nervous facing Skalardra. What should we do?	
Hmm? What's wrong everybody?	
Political power means nothing on the field.	
Huh? I think Linmay is prettier.	3
Linmay	
Linmay is asking you what you think is it that makes this team great. You weren't expecting this, but you should give her an answer.	
We have a strong lineup of players that make our star players shine brighter.	
Well, you're looking at the one person that is making this team great.	
You. I know you're doing much for the team without taking any credit.	3
Linmay	
Linmay is asking if you have a special person who you would like to share happy moments with. Let's give her an answer.	
I think that may be you.	
Every theammate there by my side on the field is special	3
My Nari dakimakura! She's the best idol in the universe and is super strong.	-1
Linmay	
Linmay is interested in Selena and is asking for your opinion. What should we say?	
She's kind and sweet. Maybe you'll have a shot?	1
Be honest and show a sincere attitude.	3
Considering your personality, I think she'll accept you.	
Linmay	
You got a couple of tickets to Veronica's live concert. Linmay seems to be interested.	
These are for you, of course. Here.	1
We're going to make it fair and gather everybody around so we can draw for the ticket.	3
I'll give you this, so get rid of that fake ticket.	
Linmay	
Linmay says she wants to cry because the goal keeper on the other team just won't go down no matter how many shots she makes.	
Let's start by picking their defenses apart.	1
Let's come up with a new strategy to give you more synergy.	1
I'll come up with a formation that can bring the best out of everybody.	3
Linmay	
Linmay seems to be determined to crush the opposing team. Let's give her some advice.	
That's the spirit! Let's teach them a lesson!	3
With your skills and dedication, I have no doubt that you will.	1
I like how you're doing your best.	1
Linmay	
Linmay wants to have an academic conversation about the 5th dimension, string theory, and other infamously hard space theories. Why...?	
(She wants you to be a good listener.)	1
(There must be a reason why she started this conversation.)	1
(Maybe she brought snacks but is too shy to share it with me.)	3
Linmay	
Linmay is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.	
I'm sure there were multiple reasons on why the kingdom fell. It's sad to hear such stories.	3
So, is that king entering the Galaxy League?	-1
Patheic... That is no king.	
Linmay	
Linmay is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.	
It's all thanks to you.	1
It's a result of team effort.	3
The opponents are mesmerized by the beauty of our players.	
Linmay	
Linmay is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with Linmay.	
I think we should come up with an action speed deck or go for counterattacks...	1
I'll try to have the ball come your way.	
We can overcome this with team effort.	3
Linmay	
You see Linmay's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Linmay. What should we do?	
She is probably not even listening...	
Let's see how long they last. Come on guys!	3
Tell me if you like her. Just say the words and i'll scout her.	
Linmay	
Linmay is having trouble focusing on the match. Let's help her out.	
I'll teach you how to meditate to synchronize the breathing with other teammates.	3
It's impossible to focus on a field with so many beautiful women.	
Just calm down a bit. You got this.	
Linmay	
Linmay, who has shown absolutely superb chemistry with you, is embarrassed and says she didn't do all of that because of you. What should we say?	
Stop being mebarrassed and just accept the compliments, will you?	1
Yeah?Well,I did what I did for you.	3
I know.	-1
Linmay	
Linmay is angry because she was criticized by her performance and is asking your opinion. Let's give her an answer.	
I want to practice with you, if that's okay with you. No?	3
I admit it. You're the best in the team.	1
I'm sure the lesson here is that all of us need to learn.	
Linmay	
It's Linmay's birthday. Let's give her a present.	
Here! I made some cookies with the team.	
I stole this treasure box from Kuma.	
This is a championship trophy replica for you. The designs are inspired by you.	3
	
Duran	
The team will not have a match for some time. Duran asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.	
Hmm, wanna go shopping?	
I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.	3
Duran	
Duran was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin himself. Let's talk to him.	
Oh, that'll be so cute!	
it would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up... Make 'em into a good meal!	3
We can play soccer with the penguins!	
Duran	
You're having a conversation with Duran about the power of Spirit Stones which is covered in secrets. Let's tell him what you think.	
I need a Spirit Stones that's as fancy as I am.	3
I won't rely on Spirit Stones.	
I would buy them all if I could.	1
Duran	
Duran is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''	
Not again...	-1
Let's do this! I'm at your disposal!	3
I like what you just said.	1
Duran	
Duran has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. He is asking for your evaluation on his plays. Let's give him an answer.	
You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.	3
Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it. You should keep that going.	
I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.	
Duran	
Duran scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate him!	
Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we score the first goal?	
That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!	3
You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!	
Duran	
You come across Sammy while walking the street with Duran. Let's talk to her.	
We'll win next time!	
Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.	
(Ignore.)	3
Duran	
Mortor and Wizol of the Peacemakers are helping an old man. Duran seems to be surprised.	
Well, what do you know! They have some decensy in them after all.	
Hmmm.	1
It's good to know that they're not shallow people.	3
Duran	
The teammates are speaking highly of Duran, saying he's a good role model. Let's add in.	
Thank you for doing whatever it takes to win.	-1
He shows dominance with elegance.	3
He's truly a role model to us all with his skills and attitude.	-1
Duran	
You come across Duran, who was overwhelmed by his opponent throughout the game. Let's cheer him up.	
Those scumbags played dirty. Ugh, I'm angry!.	
I should step on that player's foot next time.	
I'm proud that you played your game and didn't descend to the opponent's level.	3
Duran	
Let's talk to Duran who recently started to take interest in the world of angels.	
It's a place to rest for the good.	-1
I'm sure it'd be full of hypocrites.	1
I hope it's not a boring place.	3
Duran	
A big fight broke out between an angel and a demon within the team. Duran is asking for help.	
I'm going to pick sides of the one I like.	3
I hope the demon didn't say anything stupid.	
Maybe the angel said something irritating again.	
Duran	
Duran lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good... Can anybody give him some heals?	1
Well, this could all have been prevented if you consumed those Swirlies like I told you...	3
I will avenge you!	-1
Duran	
Duran suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.	-1
How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.	
Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!	-1
Duran	
Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Duran is curious and wants to take a look.	
We should probably ignore them and just walk by.	3
Let's go help them!	
They must love volunteer work!	
Duran	
Duran is asking you if you ever saw the World Tree. Let's tell him your thoughts.	
Let's not talk about anything irrelevant to the match.	3
It's something I'd want to see again with a person I care.	
It's nothing but a tree.	1
Duran	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Duran having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match.	-1
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?	-1
...I see two idiots standing in front of me...	3
Duran	
Duran is impressed by the help he received from the elementals. Let's talk to him.	
The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.	3
I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!	
I am so thankful to them.	
Duran	
Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?	
We will confront them fair and square, and win.	1
I'll go blow up their lodging.	-1
Pathetic. We'll show them that we're better in many ways.	3
Duran	
Duran brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...	
Throw it away. NOW.	3
Drink it up!	
Duran	
As Duran said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to him.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	3
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	1
Duran	
Duran is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to him.	
I hope this won't affect your perfomance on the field.	3
The fans love your perfomance!	
Shoud've practiced that autograph like i told you.	
Duran	
Duran is thinking about what Selena said about saving the galaxy if we win the Galaxy League.	
Then we should do our very best to win.	-1
I can play along if there's something in it for me.	
It's not good to just belive what others say.	
Duran	
Duran says to you that it was an honor to be able to play with you. Let's give him an answer.	
Let's do our best until the very end.	
I never imagined that I'd be used like this.	
I'm starting to enjoy playing with you.	3
Duran	
Duran is saying that his teammates are what keeps him going.	
(Put your thumbs up, wink, and send a juicy smile.)	
(Pat him on the head.)	-1
(Just nod your head.)	3
Duran	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Duran asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel like I can fly" or something?	3
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	-1
Duran	
The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?	
A square match is what suites a proud royalty.	3
Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?	
That has nothing to do with us.	
Duran	
Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Duran wants to say a word.	
Get yourselves together, guys. Are you going to give up already?	3
Come on guys, you know it's an exciting thing to be playing against a strong team! Keep your heads up high!	
They will be sacrificed for our victory and honor.	
Duran	
The crowd is cheering for Duran. Duran seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help him out.	
The're all in love with your enthusiastic play	1
They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular	-1
How about just accepting the compliments for today?	3
Duran	
Cracsus threatens to hack Duran's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?	
Let's blackmail Robin that we;ll pluck out all of his plants.	
I contacted Hildegard.	
Don't fall for this cheap shot.	1
Duran	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	1
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	
Duran	
Duran points out that the time the men of Minerva died and the time the epidemic broke out in Metro City matches.	
I think that had something to do with dirty money.	
It would disgust me if that was the result of an evil plot.	3
That's too convenient to be a coincidence.	
Duran	
It's a very intense match and Duran falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Duran up and the two exchange smiles.	
Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?	3
True sportsmanship! Wonderful!	
That player must have a heart of gold.	
Duran	
Duran is thinking about what the Universe of Oblivion is.	
Don't be sacared about such petty things.	3
I don't like the word oblivion.	
I don't care as long as it doesn't harm me.	
Duran	
Duran, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal what your agenda really is. What should we say?	
To become the strongest being in space!  I shall tramp on everything that stands in my path!	
Just playing soccer, that's all.	3
To bring justice with soccer. That's all.	
Khirel	
The team is saying bad things about Khirel for skipping practice. Time to intervene.	
Do you really think that he would skip practice?	3
Skipping practice isn't something that's in his disctionary.	1
His love towards soccer is real.	
Khirel	
Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give him some advice.	
Is winning really worth going that far?	
I don't see anything wrong as long as you can get away with it.	-1
Be true to yourself.	
Khirel	
Khirel plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.	
I'm thinking of opening a shop.	
We'll see about it after the League.	
I don't care what I do after the League as long as i get to continue playing soccer.	3
Khirel	
Khirel seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.	
The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.	
Let's open up a bright future with this ball.	3
Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)	
Khirel	
The team is having a good run and Khirel is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.	
Let's keep this mementum going!	3
As long as we're not used as training material....	
There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.	1
Khirel	
You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.	
If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.	1
I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.	3
Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.	
Khirel	
Khirel's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next match. What should we say to him?	
If you keep it up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.	
Remember that feeling and use it when things get rough.	3
Consumed alot of swirlies, I see.	
Khirel	
You forgot to lock Khirel and almost used him as training material! He looks very upset!	
It's my fault.	3
It was just to motivate you to become a better player!	
It's your fault.	
Khirel	
Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?	
The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!	3
Has he gone mad?	-1
I guess he's happy this is a good match.	
Khirel	
Khirel seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. He seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?	
It's within our grasp.	3
I would like to hear what you think is the best team in the universe.	
(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.)	
Khirel	
Khirel is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?	
(I want every day to be exciting and fun.)	-1
(I just don't want to waste a single day in my life.)	
(I want my dreams to come true.)	-1
Khirel	
Khirel is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.	
Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.	3
Well, having a good ace skill is a start.	
Flawless skills.	
Khirel	
Khirel is having trouble deciding a name for his special move. His options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.	
I'm sure you're going to become an intergalactic fool.	3
I..Respect your naming taste...	-1
Cool! Keep it up!	1
Khirel	
Khirel seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to him.	
Everybody should grow up.	1
It'll be alright. Don't worry.	
Le's go look for him. 	
Khirel	
Khirel is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to him?	
How about we play baseball today?	-1
No,It's not boring.	3
If you're up for suggestion,I'm all ears.	1
Khirel	
Khirel is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to him.	
It's silly of you to worry about such things. Are you feeling okay?	
We must have faith in the Gate Keepers and win the Galaxy League.	3
A mysterious villain...Bad taste, if you ask me.	
Khirel	
Khirel is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?	
I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.	-1
All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.	1
I can tell that he's a very dilligent person that always tries his best.	3
Khirel	
You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!	
Cool! Awesome!	1
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	-1
...Uh...So no soccer?	
Khirel	
Khirel is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to him.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	3
I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.	
Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.	1
Khirel	
Khirel seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.	1
I guess that natural. The matches against them were great	
Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!	-1
Khirel	
Khirel is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Iron Canyon.	
I want one of those. It'll be fun to have a pet dragon.	
I can feel the strength of that majestic creature.	
Hmm...If only I could change the shape of the horns and the color of the scales. That'd be perfect.	
Khirel	
It's before the 2nd half, and Khirel is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.	
We should at least put up a fight so they remember us.	
There's nothing we can really do. Let's just get this over with.	
Don't give up until the end.	3
Khirel	
During a match, Khirel bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?	
Wasn't that glitch?	
We have to keep on going.	
It's something that happened during the match.Don't be so hard on yourself.	3
Khirel	
Khirel is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.	
There're on cooldown	
They support us from the shadows.	
Even if they are not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?	3
Khirel	
Khirel is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell him?	
To win all the way, of course.	
Best of 4 should be oar goal.	3
Teamwork is what matters the most.	1
Khirel	
Khirel is confused that he won the MVP. What should you tell him?	
Nicely done! We're throwing a party today!	
You deserve it. Well done!	3
Aren't you satisified with your performance?	1
Khirel	
Khirel is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.	
This needs to be analyzed and fixed.  Can you help me?	
Passes that you prefer aren't always the right answer.	1
It can't be perfect every time.	
Khirel	
On a day off, Khirel is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.	
I'd love to have a stable job first.	
It's really hard to find the right person.	1
If you find a beautiful woman, try talking to her!	1
Khirel	
Khirel seems to be lost after having a good match while his fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to him.	
They say the fortune-telling is innacurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.	
It's just a myth. Forget about it.	
Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune telling.	1
Khirel	
Khirel seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.	
Let's make an armor out of spirit stones.	
Maybe if you increase your strength.	
Don't be weak.	3
Khirel	
There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?	
What's done is done. Let's come up with a new design.	
It's finally time for some festival-soccer!	
Let's split up and find the uniforms.	3
Khirel	
Khirel came to you after the match, and says he's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	
Let's work up a solution. 	1
I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over. 	3
Just please go with that boring strategy. 	
Khirel	
It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Khirel and talk about what to do.	
We can't give it up here. There's still a chance to win.	
I hope they have a "Continue" button around here.	
Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.	1
	
Saramir	
The crowd is cheering for Saramir. Saramir seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.	
They're all in love with your enthusiatic play.	
They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.	3
How about just accepting the compliments for today?	
Saramir	
Saramir picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.	
So, this is how the revelation begins!	
Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...	3
Let's contact her and return this.	1
Saramir	
Saramir suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.	3
How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.	
Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!	
Saramir	
Saramir is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.	
(Put your thumbs up,wink,and send a juicy smile.)	
(Pat her on the head.)	3
(Just nod your head.)	
Saramir	
As Saramir said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	3
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	
Saramir	
Saramir is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.	
The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.	
I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!	1
I am so thankful to them.	3
Saramir	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Saramir asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel like I can fly" or something?	
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	3
Saramir	
Saramir is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.	
This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!	
Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!	
How about some presents for you parents?	1
Saramir	
The team will not have a match for some time. Saramir asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.	
Hmm, wanna go shopping?	3
I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody	
Saramir	
Saramir thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.	
That's because you haven't opened up your "third eye"!	
Isn't that the same with all other Beastmen?	3
Hmm, her tail is a bit weird and her ears are definitely human...	
Saramir	
Saramir is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.	
I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.	
The fans love your performance!	1
Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.	3
Saramir	
Saramir was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.	
Oh. that'll be so cute.	3
It would be good to have one of each color. and when they're all grown up... Make' em into a good meal!	
We can play soccer with the penguins.	
Saramir	
Saramir scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!	
Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we score the first goal?	
That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!	
You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!	1
Saramir	
Saramir lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?	
Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...	
I will avenge you!	
	
Yumi	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Yumi asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel like I can fly" or something?	-1
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	
Yumi	
Yumi says that the Swirlies are missing.	
They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.	-1
They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.	
I evolved them.	
Yumi	
Yumi is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.	
Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.	
It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy! This is nonsense!	
We haven't awakened our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyond!	-1
Yumi	
Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Yumi is curious and wants to take a look.	
We should probably ignore them and just walk by.	
Let's go help them!	3
They must love volunteer work!	
Yumi	
Yumi says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?	
That's unacceptable!	
You can only find your true potential when you don't rely on your skills!	
Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.	3
Yumi	
Yumi is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?	
It's the place where the chosen ones learn about their destiny.	
It's the place of dreams colliding.	3
It's stressful because we can't prepare for extraterrestrial sanitation. We're completely exposed to all those unknown...things.	
Yumi	
It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?	
I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.	
I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.	
Wow, congratulations! (Claps)	3
Yumi	
Yumi seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?	
I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.	3
The eyepatch...Iwonder if she washes it. She seems to have it on at all time.	
That's a dangeroius secret you're trying to find out about. Do you still want to know?	1
Yumi	
Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.	
Well, now what?	
Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?	
A crow?!	3
Yumi	
Yumi is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.	
Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!	3
You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.	
I knew this day would come.	
Aslan	
Aslan is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.	
If you're better than your teammates, you should be the one to be considerate.	-1
I'm not comfortable with this converstation.	
He can be irritating.	-1
Aslan	
The teammates are speaking highly of Aslan, saying she's a good role model. Let's add in.	
Thank you for doing whatever it takes to win.	
She shows dominance with elegance.	1
She's truly a role model to us all with her skills and attitude.	3
Aslan	
Aslan is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''	
Not again...	
Let's do this! I'm at your disposal!	1
I like what you just said.	3
Aslan	
Aslan seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see a problem with it	3
I guess that's natural.	
Is there someone on that team that you like?	
Aslan	
Aslan seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.	
Let's make an armor out of spirit stones.	
Maybe if you increase your strength.	
Don't be weak.	1
Aslan	
Aslan is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.	
They're on cooldown.	
They support us from the shadows.	
Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?	1
Aslan	
A big fight broke out between an angel and a demon within the team. Aslan is asking for help.	
I'm going to pick sides of the one I like.	
I hope the demon didn't say anything stupid.	3
Maybe the angel said something irritating again.	
Aslan	
The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?	
A square match is what suites a proud royalty.	1
Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?	3
That has nothing to do with us.	
Aslan	
You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.	
If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.	
I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.	1
Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.	
Aslan	
It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Aslan and talk about what to do.	
We can't give it up here. There's still a chance to win.	-1
I hope they have a "Continue" button around here.	
Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.	3
Aslan	
You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.	
How can I earn gold? Where do I have to go to find the REAL Underground?	
It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.	1
So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.	3
Aslan	
Cracsus threatens to hack Aslan's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?	
Let's blackmail Robin that we'll pluck out of his plants.	
I contacted Hildegard.	
Don't fall for this cheap shot.	3
Aslan	
Aslan came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	
Let's work up a solution.	3
I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.	
Just please go with that boring strategy	
Aslan	
Aslan seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.	
They say the fotune telling is inaccurate if you don't pa sufficient price.	
It's just a myth let's forget about it.	
Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune telling.	1
Aslan	
Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Aslan wants to say a word.	
Get yourselves together, guys. Are you going to give up already?	1
Come on guys, you know it' an exciting thing to be playing against a strong team! Keep your heads up high!	
They will be sacrificed for our victory and honor.	
Aslan	
Aslan's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?	
If you keep it up like that you's be able to play superbly in any position.	3
Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.	
Consumed a lot of Swirlies, i see.	
 	
Rudiel	
Rudiel falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?	
If that's all you got, just stay down. It's okay.	
Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!	-1
Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.	
	
King Jin	
After a meeting, King Jin's eyes met yours a several times and King Jin asks if he has something on his face.	
Yeah, Kuma's hat...	
I was just thinking the team became stronger, thanks to you.	1
I was just thinking about how much you do for the team.	
Jin	
King Jin is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.	
Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.	3
Well, having a good ace skill is a start.	1
Flawless skills.	1
Jin	
King Jin is worried that he has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous things. What should we tell him?	
Look at the beautiful players! This is paradise!	3
You're the most dangerous of them all.	
Makes it worth the challenge, don't you think so?	-1
Jin	
King Jin's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next match. What should we say to him?	
If you keep up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.	1
Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.	3
Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.	
Jin	
With a serious face, King Jin is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give him an answer.	
Being together is enough for me.	
A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?	1
Well, I'm sure we'll get an answer when we get to the end of this.	1
Jin	
King Jin comes to you and says that he has to leave the team because of personal reasons. What should we say?	
Well,I don't want to be the one holding your back .Good luck!	
There will always be a place for you to return	-1
So,how does this work ? Do i tap "Sell"?	3
Jin	
You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also King Jin's rival, has been severely injured and is in the hospital. What should you say to him?	
Sorry for the bad news. Do you want to pay a visit?	
This is our chance to steal his precious collection.	3
This won't be the end of your rival.	
Jin	
You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.	
If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.	
I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.	3
Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.	
Jin	
King Jin came to you after the match, and says he's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	 
Let's work up a solution	1
I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.	3
Just please go with that boring strategy	
Jin	
King Jin is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to him.	
I want you to form a team and catch every single bear near this locker room.	1
...If you want ot say something, it's alright. I'll be listening.	3
Let's go tell the manager.	
Jin	
King Jin is having trouble focusing on the match. Let's help him out.	
I'll teach you how to meditate to synchronize the breathing with other teammates.	
It's impossible to focus on a field with so many beautiful women.	3
Just calm down a bit. You got this.	
Jin	
King Jin doesn't like the new team advertisement video.	
there's not enough fan service	3
it didn't portray your awesome performance.	
it didn't have to have the benchwarmers in the video	
Jin	
Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?	
The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!	3
Has he gone mad?	-1
I guess he's happy this is a good match.	1
Jin	
King Jin seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.	
Let's make armor out of Spirit Stones.	-1
Maybe if you increase your Strength...	1
Don't be weak	
Jin	
King Jin is asking if you have a special person who you would like to share happy moments with. Let's give him an answer.	
I think that may be you.	1
Every teammate there by my side on the field is special.	
My Nari dakimakura! She's the best idol in the universe and is super strong.	3
Jin	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. King Jin is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously. 	3
He's obviously obsessed with soccer. 	
This is good. We can use this chance to break their backline.	
Jin	
King Jin is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.	
I'm sure there were multiple reasons on why the kingdom fell.It's sad to hear such stories.	
So,is that king entering the Galaxy League?	3
Patheic... That is no king.	1
Jin	
It's King Jin's birthday. Let's give him a present.	
Here!  I made some cookies with the team.	1
I stole this treasure box from Kuma.	3
This is a championship trophy replica for you.  The designs are inspired by you.	
Jin	
King Jin is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?	
I heard he's a super agent form Nebrion.	
All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.	1
I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.	3
Jin	
King Jin is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.	
It's all thanks to you.	1
It's a result of team effort.	-1
The opponents are mesmerized by the beauty of our players.	3
Jin	
You see King Jin's opponent trash talking and smirking towards King Jin. What should we do?	
He is probably not even listening...	1
Let's see how long they last.Come on guy!	-1
Tell me if you like him. Just say the words and I'll scout him.	3
Jin	
It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?	
I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.	-1
I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.	
Wow, congratulations! (Claps)	
Jin	
The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?	
Manga, anime, and figures...! Here I come!	
It's time for some good food.	1
I guess I can go to the soccer gear shop.	-1
Jin	
King Jin seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.	1
I guess that's natural.The matches against them were great.	3
Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!	
Jin	
You got a couple of tickets to Veronica's live concert. King Jin seems to be interested.	
These are for you, of course. Here.	
We're going to make it fair and gather everybody around so we can draw for the ticket.	
I'll give you this, so get rid of that fake ticket.	3
Jin	
King Jin seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.	
The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.	
Let's open up a bright future with this ball.	3
Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)	
Jin	
King Jin is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.	
He's just material for levelling up.	
I like how all of the Gate Keepers have different characteristics.	
That bear ... Is a hero ...!	3
Jin	
King Jin is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to him.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	
I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.	
Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.	1
	
Kirin	
You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Kirin hands you a present.	
(A cute and pretty pendant)	
(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)	3
(A chocker with a pretty radical design.)	1
Kirin	
Kirin is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.	
My teammates and their flawless play!	
My friends from previous life... They would be pleased to see me win.	
My fans!	3
Kirin	
Kirin says he's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give him an answer.	
They're young but they have passion.	
Yeah, I mean they could get hurt.	1
Teach them how adults play soccer.	
Kirin	
Kirin says he's the center of the team and asks if you agree with him. How should we answer?	
Of course! Everybody is counting on you!	-1
Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.	3
I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.	1
Kirin	
Kirin says he was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.	
Tell them they should remember that they play for you.	
Just hear them out and smile. They'll feel better.	1
You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.	3
Kirin	
Kirin says that he thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give him an answer.	
That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy, and love.	-1
I think she likes him.	
Maybe she's up to something.	3
Kirin	
Kirin says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.	
Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.	3
That's strange. I thought he was more of an authoritative character.	
Yeah, they get along pretty well.	
Kirin	
Kirin says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.	
Hmm, a revived person that forgot his purpose...Reminds me of somebody.	
He'll remember someday.	3
That's bad. I'm sure it's something important!	
Kirin	
Kirin says that the Swirlies are missing.	
They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.	-1
They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.	
I evolved them.	
Kirin	
Kirin is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became his life. Let's talk with him.	
Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!	3
Life, eh? I guess that's a bit too serious for me, but I think I understand how you feel.	
And that's how we walk towards our destiny.	-1
Kirin	
Kirin is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help him?	
It's the place where the chosen ones learn about their destiny.	-1
It's the place of dreams colliding.	3
It's stressful because we can't prepare for extraterrestrial sanitation. We're completely exposed to all those unknown...things.	
Kirin	
Kirin looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to him?	
Where do you think those comets are going?	1
Do you think any of those comets are populated?	
The space has prepared this beautiful stage for you.	-1
Kirin	
Kirin went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?	
We should think about how to make fun of him when he comes back.	3
I feel sorry for the other team.	1
Kirin is in danger! We have to save him!	-1
Kirin	
This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?	
Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.	
I heard that the bath products on Earth are the best in the universe.	1
I'm going to check out the new comic issues. Wanna come along?	1
Kirin	
Kirin seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.	
Be careful not to be stomped on...	
We can do this! Let's go!	
Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?	3
Kirin	
Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Kirin seems to be troubled. What should we do?	
If you guys keep giving Kirin trouble, I swear to god I'll use you both as special training material.	1
If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?	3
You both need to be disciplined by Kirin.	-1
Kirin	
Kirin seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell him?	
Congratulations! How did you guys get along?	1
Don't forget that we exist! Haha!	3
Good for you! I know it's hard for you to find someone at your level!	
Kirin	
Ogre's pony tail slapped Kirin in the face!	
Even his hair is a weapon! Is that even allowed? 	
That must hurt.	
Ugh...Gross...	1
Kirin	
Kirin thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.	
That's because you haven't opened up your "third eye"!	-1
Isn't that the same with all other Beastmen?	3
Hmm, her tail is a bit weird and her ears are definitely human...	
Kirin	
It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?	
I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.	
I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.	
Wow, congratulations! (Claps)	3
Kirin	
Kirin asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give him a sincere answer.	
I guess I'll be chasing you on the road of glory.	1
I want to see everybody smile.  I think that'll make me happy.	-1
I'm going to make a joke before I start crying!	
Kirin	
Kirin is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle.	
You seem like the princess... Scratch that, the queen.	-1
She seems like a nice girl.	1
It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.	1
Kirin	
Kirin is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.	
It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.	
Do I have to stop the match?	
It's time, Kirin! Awaken the 6th attribute and show your true powers!	-1
Kirin	
Kirin is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.	
Do you think they'll be tasty?	3
I think they're cute and elegant if you leave out the pig and the bear.	
I'd like to keep one as a pet.	-1
Kirin	
Kirin is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to him.	
Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.	
It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy! This is nonsense!	
We haven't awakened our TRUE power! We have to go further beyond!	-1
Kirin	
Kirin is suddenly showing massive improvement in his performance. He must've learned something during a match.	
Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!	
You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.	
I knew this day would come.	-1
Kirin	
Kirin says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to him?	
That's unnacceptable!	
You can only find your true potential when you don't rely on your skills!	
Well, we can't do anything about that right now. Let's focus more on passing the ball.	3
Kirin	
Kirin seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?	
I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.	
The eyepatch... I wonder if she washes it. She seems to have it on at all times.	1
That's a dangerous secret you're trying to find out about. Do you still want to know?	-1
Kirin	
Kirin wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give him an answer.	
Beginner level monsters in an RPG game.	1
Thankful beings that will be our +160.	3
I'm planning to make a whole line of merchandise with them as the character.	
Kirin	
Kirin is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to him.	
Life is a light of its own.	
That's deep. I think it's cool.	
How about we make it to the top of the Galaxy League and shine the universe with the light within us?	1
Kirin	
Kirin says he's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.	
Is her name really Kiki?	
Ask her if she likes you and if she wants to join our team.	-1
Tell her to be our lap cat.	
	
Beatrice	
Beatrice is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle.	
You seem like the princess... Scratch that, the queen.	-1
She seems like a nice girl.	
It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.	1
Beatrice	
Beatrice suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.	
What's the agenda here?  Are you trying to taint the pure angels?	
This is a good chance to show the baby angels how rough soccer can be!	
That would be wonderful!  I'll go ask for permission.	3
Beatrice	
The team manger ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?	
We could start a reset marathon.	
We're going to hunt that manager down and take back our money. We will show no mercy!	-1
Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.	
Beatrice	
Beatrice claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?	
She must've made a mistake.	1
Maybe Sophie is actually a male..?	
I don't care what the case is.	
Beatrice	
You're sick and in bed when Beatrice and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?	
You guys... I'm about to cry...	1
I'm sorry... I should be giving you guys tea or something, but...	
Get closer so I can spread my germs!	
Beatrice	
Beatrice is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.	
I hope you get scouted by an interesting team.	
Make the scouters fall in love with your performance.	
Let's make that our goal and make it happen.	3
Beatrice	
This was the worst game in your entire life...Beatrice comes to you to cheer you up.	
Please explain why you kicked the ball into our goal post, will you?	
Thanks...I know you're the one that's the most devastated...Let's do better next time.	
Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.	3
Beatrice	
Beatrice says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.	
That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy, and love.	-1
I think she likes him.	
Maybe she's up to something.	
Beatrice	
Beatrice thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?	
First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.	3
Of course we should tell Lynbell! What are you waiting for?	
...Sometimes, the truth is better to be left a secret.	
Beatrice	
Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Beatrice seems to be troubled. What should we do?	
If you guys keep giving Beatrice trouble, I swear to god I'll use both as special training material.	3
If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?	
You both need to be disciplined by Beatrice.	
Beatrice	
MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.	
Stop right there!	-1
Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?	
...Maybe he just like cats!	
	
Zhen Long	
Zhen Long thinks he knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?	
First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.	
Of course we should tell Lynbell! What are you waiting for?	
...Sometimes, the truth is better to be left a secret.	-1
Zhen Long	
Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Zhen Long.	
I think he felt better because of the positive energy you always have around you.	1
Maybe he got embarrassed for being obsessed with his past?	3
You saved us all from awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.	
Zhen Long	
The team manger ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?	
We could start a reset marathon.	
We're going to hunt that manager down and take back our money. We will show no mercy!	
Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.	3
Zhen Long	
The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.	
Let's see what you have to say after the match.	3
I didn't know I was a talented foot volleyball player!	
Care to receive the ball with your face?	
Zhen Long	
The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Zhen Long do?	
(Give him instructions so that he can do his share of the cleaning quickly.)	
(Let him take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)	3
(Let him clean, but warn him not to cause any trouble.)	
Zhen Long	
Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.	
The stage is so majestic! It's awesome!	-1
This proves that even the aliens like Nari.	
I think she's something more than just an idol.	1
Zhen Long	
Zhen Long looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.	
Did you prepare your meds in case you get space sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.	
Don't worry. Leave it up to me.	-1
Littre will be fine.	
Zhen Long	
Zhen Long is stressed out saying his opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?	
You can overcome this like always. Right?	
It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.	
Let's solve the problems one by one.	1
Zhen Long	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	
Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.	1
Let's give them a hand.	
Clarisa	
Clarisa is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.	
Everybody is not at 100%.But,i think we'll do better sooner or later.	
It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy!This is nonsense!	
We haven't awakened our TRUE powers!We have to go further beyond!	
	
Swimsuit Qiyou	
You come across Swimsuit Qiyou being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.	
Are you feeling alright?	
Don't use that ability on the field...	
Don't worry, I'll go with you.	1
	
Ciel	
The match started and Ciel is standing still doing nothing.	
What is she doing?  Is she a totem?	1
Run!  Just start running!	
Looks like we'll have to do without her.	
	
Jess	
Jess caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?	
I think we should hang him.	
Why didn't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing,	3
You came to see my marvelopus moves? I'm flattered.	
	
Enthia	
Enthia seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.	
Be careful not to be stomped on...	
We can do this! Let's go!	3
Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?	
Enthia	
Enthia says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.	
That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy, and love.	-1
I think she likes him.	3
Maybe she's up to something.	
Enthia	
Enthia says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.	
Tell them they should remember that they play for you.	-1
Just hear them out and smile. They'll feel better	
You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.	
Mimi	
Mimi is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.	
I'll sleep by your side tonight.	
I see. We must be careful. I'll be watching over you.	-1
It's just a dream. Forget about it.	
	
Irru	
Irru suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.	3
How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.	
Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!	1
Irru	
Irru is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help him?	
It's the place where the chosen ones learn about their destiny.	
It's the place of deams colliding.	
It's stressful because we can't prepare for extraterrestrial sanitation. We're completely exposed to all those unknow....things. 	-1
Irru	
It's a very intense match and Irru falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Irru up and the two exchange smiles.	
Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?	-1
True sportsmanship! Wonderful!	
That player must have a heart of gold.	
	
Rigoletto	
A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?	
I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!	
Don't kill him, okay?	
We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.	3
Rigoletto	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Rigoletto some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	
Make him know who he's up against.	
Let's try out some forward passes.	3
	
Vermilion Bird	
Vermilion Bird seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.	
The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.	
Let's open up a bright future with this ball.	
Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)	
Vermilion Bird	
Latios is chatting with Vermilion Bird after the match. Let's barge in.	
Don't you think about sneaking him out. He's our pretty boy.	-1
Vermilion Bird was fantastic on the field, right?	1
I'm looking forward to our next match!	
	
Kaidormu	
Kaidormu seems to be lost after having a good match while his fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to him.	
They say the fortune-telling is innacurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.	
It's just a myth. Forget about it.	1
Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune telling.	
Kaidormu	
During a match, Kaidormu bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	-1
We have to keep on going.	
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself	
Kaidormu	
Kaidormu came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.	
What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?	-1
I'm sure you got scammed.	
I hope that wasn't all you got.	
Ernesto	
Ernesto caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?	
I think we should hang him.	
Why didn't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing,	
You came to see my marvelopus moves? I'm flattered.	-1
Ernesto	
Ernesto is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.	
It's surprising to see such advanced technology.	-1
Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.	
Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.	
	
Xing	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	
Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.	1
Let's give them a hand.	
Xing	
Xing is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?	
I don't think you need to worry about a diet.	1
You're playing soccer! You're fine!	
Please don't forget about the match.	
	
Castor	
Castor was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin himself. Let's talk to him.	
Oh. that'll be so cute.	
It would be good to have one of each color. and when they're all grown up... Make' em into a good meal!	
We can play soccer with the penguins.	3
Castor	
Castor is impressed by the help he received from the elementals. Let's talk to him.	
The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.	
I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!	
I am so thankful to them.	3
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Celus	
Celus is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to him.	
Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later. 	
It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy! This is nonsense! 	1
We haven't awakened our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyond! 	
Celus	
Celus is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give him an opinion.	
This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!	3
Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!	
How about some presents for your parents?	
Celus	
The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?	
Manga, anime, and figures...! Here I come!	
It's time for some good food.	
I guess I can go to the soccer gear shop.	1
Celus	
Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Celus on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?	
You and I are already perfect. So I guess that means we shouldn't be saying our names. 	3
I can't pick just one...	
I think it should be you, but will you be able to return to your normal life after all of this is...Wait, I'm going off topic, right?	
Celus	
Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.	
Well, now what?	-1
Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?	
A crow?!	
Celus	
Celus wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?	
Perfect planning and perfect execution.	
All goes as planned... Hmm? Just ignore that.	3
Why don't you join them and find out?	1
Celus	
Celus is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.	
It's all thanks to you.	
It's a result of team effort.	-1
The opponents are mesmerized by the beauty of our players.	
Celus	
Celus seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?	
I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.	
The eyepatch... I wonder if she washes it. She seems to have it on at all times.	
That's a dangerous secret you're trying to find out about. Do you still want to know?	3
	
Elua	
Elua is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?	
You can overcome this like always. Right?	
It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.	
Let's solve the problems one by one.	1
Elua	
Elua is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?	
Don't worry about me! Do your job!	
Can you peel this guy off of me?	-1
Don't come over here! It's dangerous!	
Elua	
Elua was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.	
Oh, that'll be so cute!	3
It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make'em into a good meal!	
We can play soccer with the penguins!	
Elua	
Latios is chatting with Elua after the match. Let's barge in.	
Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's our pretty girl.	3
Elua was fantastic on the field, right?	
I'm looking forward to our next match!	
Elua	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	3
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	
Elua	
Elua is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.	
I'm afraid to be honest.	
I was always looking forward for that moment.	
Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes will you?	3
Elua	
The team will not have a match for some time. Elua asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.	
Hmmm, wanna go shopping?	3
I have a very hard training session all planed up for everybody.	
	
Hercules	
Hercules isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. He feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.	
Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.	
Let's invest some Crystals and get new players!	
We may have to go rough on the team and make them realize the problem. 	3
Hercules	
Hercules, who is determined to make everything in his life, even his dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.	
It was an intense feeling as if I was going against the strongest team in the universe.	1
I've never dreamt about soccer.	
I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.	
Hercules	
Hercules came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.	
What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?	-1
I'm sure you got scammed.	-1
I hope that wasn't all you got.	
Hercules	
You're sick and in bed when Hercules and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?	
You guys... I'm about to cry...	
I'm sorry... I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...	1
Get closer so I can spread my germs!	
Hercules	
Hercules wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.	
Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.	1
The character story left him a trauma.	1
Maybe he just wants to duke it out.	
Hercules	
Hercules won a trip around the world from a radio event!	
What about soccer? You'll have to go through me to go on that trip!.	
Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.	-1
....World? What about space? Isn't that more interesting?	
Hercules	
You're talking to Hercules about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow. Let's tell him your answer.	
I would say goodbye to all my friends. 	
If it's the end of the world, I'd pull of a crazy performance in a densely populated area before I go!	
Hmm, there's a guy I'd like to beat up before I die. 	3
Hercules	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	3
Stop right there, pig!	
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	
Hercules	
The match and the concert that Hercules was looking for start at the same time...	
Let's hack the big screen so we can see the concert!	
Channel that sorrow and rage towards your opponents and make them pay. 	3
I'm sorry that you couldn't go.	
Hercules	
Hercules announces that he will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give him an answer.	
You'll have to compete with me!	
I feel bad for the players that have to face you.	-1
I have faith in you.	
	
Isillia	
With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Isillia for solutions.	
We won't be able to win the league if we fail to overcome this.	1
I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance.	3
How about we put that advanced technology of Metro City to use?	-1
Isillia	
Isillia is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.	
It's only a sport! The strongest team wins, and we are strong!        	
I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.        	3
Aren't you the one everybody should be afraid of?        	
Isillia	
The match and the concert that Isillia was looking for start at the same time...	
Let's hack the big screen so we can see the concert!	
Channel that sorrow and rage towards your opponents and make them pay.	1
I'm sorry that you couldn't go.	3
Isillia	
You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Isillia and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.	
Let's give her some space.	3
I could really use some grilled sweet potatoes and chestnuts.	
There's no time for tears! Find out who did this and bring justice.	-1
Isillia	
Isillia won a trip around the world from a radio event!	
What about soccer? You'' have to go through me to go on that trip!	-1
Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.	3
...World? What about space? Isn't that more interesting	1
Isillia	
The match started and Isillia is standing still doing nothing.	
What is she doing? Is she a totem?	1
Run! Just start running!	
Looks like we'll have to do without her.	
Isillia	
The team manger ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?	
We could start a reset marathon.	
We're going to hunt that manager down and take back our money. We will show no mercy!	
Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.	3
Isillia	
Isillia is asking you if you ever saw the World Tree. Let's tell her your thoughts.	
Let's not talk about anything irrelevant to the match.	
It's something i'd want to see again with a person I care.	3
It's nothing but a tree.	
Isillia	
Mortor and Wizol of the Peacemakers are helping an old man. Isillia seems to be surprised.	
Well, what do you know! They have some decency in them after all.	3
Hmmm.	
It's good to know that they're not shallow people.	1
Isillia	
Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?	
We will confront them fair and square, and win.	3
I'll go blow up their lodging.	-1
Pathetic. We'll show them that we're better in many ways.	
Isillia	
You're sick and in bed when Isillia and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?	
You guys... I'm about to cry...	1
I'm sorry... I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...	3
Get closer so I can spread my germs!	
Isillia	
The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.	
Let's see what you have to say after the match.	3
I didn't know I was a talented foot volleyball player!	1
Care to receive the ball with your face?	-1
Isillia	
Isillia is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''	
Not again...	-1
Let's do this! I'm at your disposal!	
I like what you just said.	1
Isillia	
Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Isillia wants to say a word.	
Get yourselves together, guys. Are you going to give up already?	
Come on guys, you know it's an exciting thing to be playing against a stong team! Keep your heads up high!	3
They will be sacrified for our victory and honor.	
Isillia	
Isillia is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.	
If you're better than your teammates, you should be the one to compensate.	-1
I'm not comfortable with this conversation.	3
He can be irritating.	
Isillia	
Isillia thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?	
First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.	-1
Of course we should tell Lynbell! What are you waiting for?	-1
...Sometimes, the truth is better to be left a secret.	-1
Isillia	
Isillia wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.	
Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.	3
The character story left him a trauma.	1
Maybe he just wants to duke it out.	
Isillia	
You're having a conversation with Isillia about the power of Spirit Stones which is covered in secrets. Let's tell her what you think.	
I need a Spirit Stone that's as fancy as I am.	1
I won't rely on Spirit Stones.	3
I would buy them all if I could.	
Isillia	
Cracsus threatens to hack Isillia's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?	
Let's blackmail Robin that we'll pluck out all of his plants.	
I contacted Hildegard.	1
Don't fall for this cheap shot.	3
Isillia	
Isillia suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.	
What's the agenda here? Are you trying to taint the pure angels?	
This is a good chance to show the baby angels how rough soccer can be!	
That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.	3
Isillia	
Isillia is thinking about what Selena said about saving the galaxy if we win the Galaxy League.	
Then we should do our very best to win.	3
I can play along if there's something in it for me.	
It's not good to just believe what others say.	1
Isillia	
The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?	
A square match is what suites a proud royalty.	1
Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?	3
That has nothing to do with us.	
Isillia	
Isillia points out that the time the men of Minerva died and the time the epidemic broke out in Metro City matches.	
I think that had something to do with dirty money	1
It would digust me if that was the result of an evil plot	
That's too convenient to be as coincidence	
Isillia	
Isillia, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal who you really are. What should we answer?	
To become the strongest being in space! I shall tramp on everything that stands in my path!	
Just playing soccer, that's all.	
To bring justice with soccer.that's all.	3
Isillia	
This was the worst game in your entire life...Isillia comes to you to cheer you up.	
Please explain why you kicked the ball into our goal post, will you?	
Thanks...I know you're the one that's the most devastated...Let's do better next time.	
Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.	3
Isillia	
You come across Isillia, who was overwhelmed by her opponent throughout the game. Let's cheer her up.	
Those scumbags played dirty. Ugh, I'm angry!	3
I should step on that player's foot next time.	
I'm proud that you played your game and didn't descend to the opponent's level.	1
Isillia	
Let's talk to Isillia who recently started to take interest in the world of angels.	
It's a place to rest for the good.	3
I'm sure it'd be full of hypocrites.	
I hope it's not a boring place.	
Isillia	
Isillia is thinking about what the Universe of Oblivion is.	
Don't be scared about such petty things.	
I don't like the word oblivion.	3
i don't care as long as it doesn't harm me.	
Isillia	
According to Isillia's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.	
I want to see Tyler's true characteristics.	
William doesn't know to respect his seniors.	-1
I thought they were just friends.	
Isillia	
MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.	
Stop right there!	
Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?	3
...Maybe he just likes cats!	
Isillia	
A big fight broke out between an angel and a demon within the team. Isillia is asking for help.	
I'm goint to pick sides of the one i like.	-1
I hope the demon didn't say anything stupid.	3
Maybe the angel said something irritating again.	
Isillia	
Isillia is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.	
I hope you get scouted by an interesting team.	
Make the scouters fall in love with your performance!	
Let's make that our goal and make it happen,	3
Isillia	
You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.	
How can I earn gold? Where do I have to go to find the REAL Underground?	
It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.	
So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.	3
	
Muspel	
Muspel is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.	
Do you think they'll be tasty?	
I think they're cute and elegant if you leave out the pig and bear. 	1
I'd like to keep one as a pet. 	
	
Sky	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	
Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.	
Let's give them a hand.	3
Sky	
You come across Sky who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?	
I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.	
Trust me and your teammates. Sit this one out.	-1
Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.	
	
Sammy	
This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?	
Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.	3
I heard that the bath products on Earth are the best in the universe.	1
I'm going to check out the new comic issues. Wanna come along?	
Sammy	
Sammy picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.	
So, this is how the revelation begins!	
Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...	3
Let's contact her and return this.	
Sammy	
Sammy is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.	
Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!	3
Life, eh? I guess that's a bit too serious for me, but I think I understand how you feel.	
And that's how we walk towards our destiny. 	
Sammy	
Sammy is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.	
Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!	3
You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.	
I knew this day would come.	
Sammy	
You come across Sammy, who was overwhelmed by her opponent throughout the game. Let's cheer her up.	
Those scumbags played dirty. Ugh, I'm angry!	
I should step on that player's foot next time.	
I'm proud that you played your game and didn't descend to the opponent's level.	3

I can play along if there's something in it for me.	
It's not good to just believe what others say.	3
Sammy	
Sammy says that the Swirlies are missing.	
They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.	
They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.	3
I evolved them.	
Sammy	
The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?	
A square match is what suites a proud royalty.	3

Sammy	
Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.	
Well, now what?	1
Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?	-1
A crow?!	3
Sammy	
Sammy wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?	
Perfect planning and perfect execution.	1
All goes as planned...Hmm? Just ignore that.	
Why don't you join them and find out?	
Sammy	
The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.	
I can't stand this...I need to end this quickly and go take a shower.	1
What a depressing weather...	-1
Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!	3
Sammy	
Sammy is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.	
If you're better than your teammates, you should be the one to be considerate.	3
I'm not comfortable with this conversation.

Let's not talk about anything irrelevant to the match.	3
It's something I'd want to see again with a person I care.	-1
It's nothing but a tree.	
Sammy	
Sammy says to you that it was an honor to be able to play with you. Let's give her an answer.	
Let's do our best until the very end!	1
I never imagined that I'd be used like this.	
I'm starting to enjoy playing with you.	3
Sammy	
Sammy says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.	
Hmm, a revived person that forgot his purpose... Reminds me of somebody.	
He'll remember someday.	3
That's bad! I'm sure it's something important!	
Sammy	
A big fight broke out between an angel and a demon within the team. Sammy is asking for help.	
I'm going to pick sides of the one I like.	
I hope the demon didn't say anything stupid.	1
Maybe the angel said something irritating again.	1
Sammy	
The teammates are speaking highly of Sammy, saying she's a good role model. Let's add in.	
Thank you for doing whatever it takes to win.	-1
She shows dominance with elegance.	3
She's truly a role model to us all with her skills and attitude.	-1
Sammy	
It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?	
I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.	-1
I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.	-1
Wow, congratulations! (Claps)	3
Sammy	
Sammy thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.	
That's because you haven't opened up your "third eye"!	-1
Isn't that the same with all other beastmen.	3
Hmm, her tail is a bit weird and her ears are definitely human...	
Sammy	
Sammy is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.	
It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.	3
Do I have to stop the match?	
It's time, Sammy! Awaken the 6th attribute and show your true powers!	
Sammy	
Mortor and Wizol of the Peacemakers are helping an old man. Sammy seems to be surprised.	
Well, what do you know! They have some decency in them after all.	
Hmmm.	1
It's good to know that they're not shallow people.	3
Sammy	
Ogre's pony tail slapped Sammy in the face!	
Even his hair is a weapon! Is that even allowed?	-1
That must hurt.	1
Ugh...Gross...	1
Sammy	
Sammy is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.	
This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!	1
Gatekeeper dolls, why not!	3
How about some presents for your parents?	1
Sammy	
You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.	
How can I earn gold? Where do I have to go to find the REAL Underground?	
It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.	3

Let's blackmail Robin that we'll pluck out all of his plants.	1
I contacted Hildegard.	-1
Don't fall for this cheap shot.	1
Sammy	
Sammy says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?	
That's unacceptable!	
You can only find your true potential when you dont rely on your skills!	
Well, we cant do anything about that right now.  Let's focus more on passing the ball.	3
Sammy	
Sammy is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''	
Not again...	
Let's do this! I'm at your disposal!	3
I like what you just said.	
Sammy	
Sammy seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?	
I don't know much about her, but she looks strong	3
The eyepatch...I wonder if she washes it. She seems to have it on at all times	
That's dangerous secret you're trying to find out about. Do you stil want to know?	
Sammy	
Sammy is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.	
Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we`ll do better sooner or later.	3
It`s all becouse nobody on this team cares about strategy! This is nonesense!	
We haven`t awakened our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyond!	-1
Sammy	
Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Sammy wants to say a word.	
Get yourselves together, guys. Are you going to give up already?	
Come on guys, you know it's an exciting thing to be playing against a strong team! Keep your heads up high!	
They will be sacrificed for our victory and honor.	1
Sammy	
You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.	
...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...	
Ugh...I want to dig my eyes out.	
Fontus...You sure are my archnemesis!	1
Sammy	
Let's talk to Sammy who recently started to take interest in the world of angels.	
It's a place to rest for the good.	-1
I'm sure it'd be full of hypocrites.	1
I hope it's not a boring place.	3
	
Skorn	
Skorn is being annoying with his offensive words. What should we do?	
(Slap him.)	-1
(Kick him out of the team if things can't be handled.)	
(Ignore it.)	
Skorn	
It's dinner time and Skorn is staring at his carrot soup with a troubled look. What should we do?	
(Eat it instead of him.)	
(Tell him to put the carrots in the soup on Hildegard's plate.)	
(Tell him that carrots are good for the body and to eat it all.)	3
Skorn	
It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking up for the morning training. What should we tell Skorn to do?	
They all need scolding.	3
Wake them up. Kick them if you need to.	
(Step on everyone that's still sleeping.)	
Skorn	
You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Skorn hands you a present.	
(A cute and pretty pendant)	
(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)	3
(A chocker with a pretty radical design.)	
Skorn	
Skorn blushes up and tells you that he's happy he can play soccer with you. What should we tell him?	
Me too. You're a good leader.	3
*Smiles bitterly*	
Hmm, I'll prepare a rougher match. 	
Skorn	
Skorn says he's the center of the team and asks if you agree with him. How should we answer?	
Of course! Everybody is counting on you!	
Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.	3
I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.	
Skorn	
Skorn seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.	
Be careful not to be stomped on...	
We can do this! Let's go!	3
Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?	
Skorn	
Skorn says that he thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give him an answer.	
That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy, and love.	-1
I think she likes him.	
Maybe she's up to something.	
Valkyrja Beth	
The teammates are speaking highly of Valkyrja Beth, saying she's a good role model. Let's add in.	
Thank you for doing whatever it takes to win.	
She shows dominance with elegance.	1
She's truly a role model to us all with her skills and attitude.	3
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth is thinking about what Selena said about saving the galaxy if we win the Galaxy League.	
Then we should do our very best to win.	3

It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.	
So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.	3
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth hurt her leg during the 1st half of the match, but she insists on playing. What should we tell her?	
Don't push yourself too hard. There are a lot of matches left.	3
Okay. You make them pay, understand?	-1
It seems as if pain is what keeps you going...	
Valkyrja Beth	
It's dinner time and Valkyrja Beth is staring at her carrot soup with a troubled look. What should we do?	
(Eat it instead of her.)	
(Tell her to put the carrots in the soup on Hildegard's plate.)	
(Tell her that carrots are good for the body and to eat it all.)	3
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth is asking you about what you like besides soccer.	
I like board games about war. I admire famous commanders.	3
Rugby, a sport of strength!	
Boxing. I like that feeling when I get hit by a punch.	
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth looks excited as she's talking with the team about pets. She turns around and asks you what kind of pet you like.	
I think that a baby duck following it's mother is one of the most adorable things to watch.	3
I like puppies. The loyal ones!	1
I like cats. I like the egoistic side of them.	
Valkyrja Beth	
Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?	
We will confront them fair and square, and win.	3
I'll go blow up their lodging.	
Pathetic. We'll show them that we're better in many ways.	
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth is asking for special training sessions because she's not satisfied with today's performance. What should we tell her?	
Good. I'll train you until you can't stand up.	-1
If that's your wish.	3
Sure. Let's get on to it.	1
Valkyrja Beth	
You're having a conversation with Valkyrja Beth about the power of Spirit Stones which is covered in secrets. Let's tell her what you think.	
I need a Spirit Stone that's as fancy as I am.	
I won't rely on Spirit Stones.	3

Well, what do you know! They have some decency in them after all.	3
Hmmm.	-1
It's good to know that they're not shallow people.	1
Valkyrja Beth	
It suddenly began to rain heavily. You see Valkyrja Beth running up ahead.	
(Catch up and share your umbrella.)	3
(Let her steal your umbrella.)	
(Run past her and smile.)	
Valkyrja Beth	
Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Valkyrja Beth is asking how she did in the match.	
You were picking the other team apart! It was awesome!	
It was pretty scart watching you so pleased with the rough plays of the opponents.	
You bring the best out of the team. Good work!	3
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth says to you that it was an honor to be able to play with you. Let's give her an answer.	
Let's do our best until the very end!	3
I never imagined that I'd be used like this.	
I'm starting to enjoy playing with you.	-1
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth is having trouble focusing on the match because of the affectionate emotion she feels. She says she must leave now to propose to her lover. What should we say?	
You don't need to be the one being dragged around.	
You will be happy, while that feeling lasts.	-1
Think about your teammates that are counting on you.	3
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal who you really are. What should we answer?	
To become the strongest being in space! I shall tramp on everything that stands in my path!	
Just playing soccer, that's all.	
To bring justice with soccer. That's all.	3
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth blushes up and tells you that she's happy she can play soccer with you. What should we tell her?	
Me too. You're a good leader.	3
*Smiles bitterly*	-1
Hmm, I'll prepare a rougher match.	
Valkyrja Beth	
Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Valkyrja Beth wants to say a word.	
Get yourselves together, guys. Are you going to give up already?	
Come on guys, you know it's an exciting thing to be playing against a strong team! Keep your heads up high!	3
They will be sacrificed for our victory and honor.	-1
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth says that the soup tastes funny. What should we do?	
It's Fine. Eat Up.	
Let's stay away from the soup, just in case.	3
We shouldn't trhow away food. Let's give it to someone else.	
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth is being annoying with her offensive words. What should we do?	
(Slap her.)	-1
(Kick her out of the team if things can't be handled.)	3
(Ignore it.)	1
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth continues to charge into the opponent's defense line and keeps failing. What should we do?	
(Make a strategic decision.)	
(Guide her by kicking the ball towards the weak link in the opponent's defense.)	
(She looks happy. Let's let her be.)	-1
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''	
Not again...	
Let's do this! I'm at your disposal!	
I like what you just said.	3
Valkyrja Beth	
Kuma is caught sneaking in the woman's locker room once again. We should talk with Valkyrja Beth about what to do with him.	
Let's make him put on Ogre's underwear.	-1
Let's make him put on Renee's underwear.	
I'm not sure if it's save, but we can use him for leveling up.	3
Valkyrja Beth	
During the team meeting, you find a player sleeping. What should you do?	
(Leave it to Valkyrja Beth.)	
(Slap the player in the back of the head.)	
(Wake the player up and continue with the meeting.)	3
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth points out that the time the men of Minerva died and the time the epidemic broke out in Metro City matches.	
I think that had something to do with dirty money	
It would digust me if that was the result of an evil plot	
That's too convenient to be as coincidence	3
Valkyrja Beth	
You come across Valkyrja Beth, who was overwhelmed by her opponent throughout the game. Let's cheer her up.	
Those scumbags played dirty. Ugh, I'm angry!	
I should step on that player's foot next time.	
I'm proud that you played your game and didn't descend to the opponent's level.	-1
Valkyrja Beth	
It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking up for the morning training. What should we tell Valkyrja Beth to do?	
They all need scolding.	
Wake them up. Kick them if you need to.	-1
(Step on everyone that's still sleeping.)	-1
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.	
If you're better than your teammates, you should be the one to compensate.	
I'm not comfortable with this conversation.	3
He can be irritating.	-1
Valkyrja Beth	
The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?	
A square match is what suites a proud royalty.	1
Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?	3
That has nothing to do with us.	
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth is thinking about what the Universe of Oblivion is.	
Don't be scared about such petty things.	
I don't like the word oblivion.	3
I don't care as long as it doesn't harm me.	
Valkyrja Beth	
Cracsus threatens to hack Valkyrja Beth's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?	
Let's blackmail Robin that we'll pluck out all his plants.	
I contacted Hildeguard.	1
Don't fall for this cheap shot.	
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth is asking you if you ever saw the World Tree. Let's tell her your thoughts.	
Let's not talk about anything irrelevant to the match.	
It's something i'd want to see again with a person I care.	3
It's nothing but a tree.	
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth did her best, but she failed to achieve the results she wanted and looks sad. We should say something to her.	
Sorry, I feel that this one is on me.	
That wasn't enough! You have to try harder!	
It's experiences like this that bonds us together.	3
Valkyrja Beth	
Valkyrja Beth is furious about the referee that's clearly favoring the other team. Should we stop her?	
	-1
The tougher it gets, the better it feels to win. Right?	
Ignore the referee. Focus on the match.	
	
Vonchi	
Ogre's pony tail slapped Vonchi in the face!	
Even his hair is a weapon! Is that even allowed?	-1
That must hurt.	
Ugh...Gross...	
Vonchi	
Vonchi is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.	
It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.	3
Do I have to stop the match?	
It's time, Vonchi! Awaken the 6th attribute and show your true powers!	
Vonchi	
Vonchi falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to him?	
If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.	
Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up.	3
Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.	
Vonchi	
The team will not have a match for some time. Vonchi asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match	3
Hmm, wanna go shopping?	
I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody	
Vonchi	
The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Vonchi and his opponent isn't over yet.	
You better win that fight	
Hey! The match is over!	1
I've never seen him worked up before	
Vonchi	
Vonchi thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.	
That's because you haven't opened up your "third eye"!	-1
Isn't that the same with all other beastmen.	3
Hmm, her tail is a bit weird and her ears are definitely human...	1
Vonchi	
Vonchi scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate him!	
Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?	
That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!	
You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!	3
Vonchi	
Vonchi picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.	
So, this is how the revelation begins!	-1
Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...	
Let's contact her and return this.	1
Vonchi	
Vonchi is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help him?	
It's the place where the chosen ones learn about their destiny.	
It's the place of dreams colliding.	3
It's stressful because we can't prepare for extraterrestrial sanitation. We're completely exposed to all those unknown...things.	
Vonchi	
Vonchi was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin himself. Let's talk to him.	
Oh, that'll be so cute!	-1
It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!	1
We can play soccer with the penguins!	3
Vonchi	
Vonchi says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.	
Hmm, a revived person that forgot his purpose... Reminds me of somebody.	
He'll remember someday.	3
That's bad! I'm sure it's something important!	
Vonchi	
Vonchi wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?	
Perfect planning and perfect execution.	1
All goes as planned... Hmm? Just ignore that.	
Why don't you join them and find out?	3
Vonchi	
Vonchi says that the Swirlies are missing.	
They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.	
They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.	3
I evolved them.	
Vonchi	
A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Vonchi.	
I feel like he's mocking us!	
It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.	-1
He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.	1
Vonchi	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Vonchi asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel I'm in heaven" or something?	
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	3
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	
Vonchi	
It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?	
I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.	
I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.	
Wow, congratulations! (Claps)	3
Vonchi	
Vonchi is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.	
My teammates and their flawless play!	1
My friends from previous life...They would be pleased to see me win.	
My fans!	
Vonchi	
Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.	
Well, now what?	
Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?	
A crow?!	3
Vonchi	
Vonchi lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good...Can anybody give him some heals?	
Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...	
I will avenge you!	3
Vonchi	
It's a very intense match and Vonchi falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Vonchi up and the two exchange smiles.	
Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?	
True sportsmanship is Wonderful!	3
That player must have a heart of gold.	1
Vonchi	
Vonchi suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How anoy we go eat salad?I'm on a diet.	
How could you think about eating at a time like this?I's disappointed in you.	
Good idea.Let's go eat some meat!	3
Vonchi	
Vonchi is saying that his teammates are what keeps him going.	
(Puts your thumbs up, wink, and send a juicy smile.)	3
(Pat him on the head.)	
(Just nod your head.)	
Vonchi	
Vonchi seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?	
I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.	3
The eyepatch...I wonder if she washes it. She seems to have it on all times.	
That's dangerous secret you're trying to find out. Do you still want to know?	
Vonchi	
Vonchi is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became his life. Let's talk with him.	
Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!	3
Life, eh? I guess that's a bit too serious for me, but I think I understand how you feel.	
And that's how we we walk towards our destiny.	
Vonchi	
The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.	
I can't stand this...I need to end this quickly and go take a shower.	
What a depressing weather...	
Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!	3
Vonchi	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	1
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	
Vonchi	
As Vonchi said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to him.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	
It's now the Galaxy Leagus.Weare the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	3
Vonchi	
Vonchi is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to him.	
I hope this won't affect you performance on the field.	
The fans love your performance!	3
Should've practiced that autograph like i told you.	
Vonchi	
Vonchi is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give him an opinion.	
This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!	
Gate Keeper dools! Why not!	3
How about some presents for your parnets?	
Vonchi	
Vonchi is impressed by the help he received from the elementals. Let's talk to him.	
The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.	-1
I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals.	
I am so thankful to them.	
Vonchi	
Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Vonchi is curious and wants to take a look.	
We should probably ignore them and just walk by.	
Let's go help them!	3
They must love volunteer work.	
Vonchi	
Vonchi brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drink looks relly scary...But we can't just throw it away...	
Throw it away. NOW.	
Drink it up!	3
Vonchi	
Vonchi is suddenly showing massive improvement in his performance. He must've learned something during a match.	
Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!	
You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.	
I knew this day would come.	-1
	
Black Ivy	
Black Ivy announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.	
You'll have to compete with me!	3
I feel bad for the players that have to face you.	
I have faith in you.	1
Black Ivy	
Black Ivy is having trouble focusing on the match. Let's help her out.	
I'll teach you how to meditate to synchronize the breathing with other teammates.	
It's impossible to focus on a field with so many handsome men.	3
Just calm down a bit. You got this.	-1
Black Ivy	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Black Ivy some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	
Make him know who he's up against.	1
Let's try out some forward passes.	1
Black Ivy	
Black Ivy is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.	
We need a decent level of personal performance.	-1
What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?	
Wreck the other team.	-1
Black Ivy	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	
Stop right there, pig!	3
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	
Black Ivy	
You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also Black Ivy's rival, has been severely injured and is in the hospital. What should you say to her?	
Sorry for the bad news. Do you want to pay a visit?	-1
This is our chance to steal his precious collection.	
This wont be the end of your rival.	
Black Ivy	
After a meeting, Black Ivy's eyes met yours a several times and Black Ivy asks if she has something on her face.	
Yeah, Kuma's hat...	
I was just thinking the team became stronger, thanks to you.	
I was just thinking about how much you do for the team.	-1
Black Ivy	
Black Ivy is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with Black Ivy.	
I think we should come up with an action speed deck or go for counterattacks...	3
I'll try to have the ball come your way.	1
We can overcome this with team effort.	-1
Black Ivy	
Black Ivy is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.	
I'm sure there were multiple reasons on why the kingdom fell. It's sad to hear such stories.	-1
So, is that king entering the Galaxy League?	
Pathetic... That is no king.	
Black Ivy	
The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Black Ivy to set some simple rules.	
This team is a mess. Gather everybody on the field. I'll knock that spirit back into you guys if I have to.	-1
Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.	3
Come on, I'll show you the best spots around!	
Black Ivy	
You see Black Ivy's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Black Ivy. What should we do?	
She is probably not even listening...	1
Let's see how long they last. Come on guys!	-1
Tell me if you like her. Just say the words and I'll scout her.	
Black Ivy	
Black Ivy wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?	
That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.	-1
What about just watching?	
Sure.Let's beat them all and take the prize money!	
Black Ivy	
Black Ivy is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to her.	
I want you to form a team and catch every single bear near this locker room.	1
...If you want to say something, it's alright. I'll be listening.	3
Let's go tell the manager.	
Black Ivy	
Black Ivy, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.	
It was an intense feeling as if I was going against the strongest team in the universe.	1
I've never dreamt about soccer.	
I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.	3
Black Ivy	
Black Ivy is worried that she has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous things. What should we tell her?	
Look at the beautiful players! This is paradise!	
You're the most dangerous of them all.	
Makes it worth the challenge, don't you think so?	-1
Black Ivy	
Black Ivy looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.	
It's space. Anything can exist here.	-1
How about we ask Jeunese?	
Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.	
Black Ivy	
Black Ivy comes to you and says that she has to leave the team because of personal reasons. What should we say?	
Well, I don't want to be the one holding you back. Good luck!	
There will always be a place for you to return.	-1
So, how does this work? Do I tap "Sell"?	
	
Duke	
Duke is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.	
It's surprising to see such advanced technology.	
Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.	3
Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.	
Duke	
There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?	
What's done is done. Let's come up with a new design.	
It's finally time for some festival-soccer!	
Let's split up and find the uniforms.	3
Duke	
You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!	
Cool! Awesome!	
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	
...Uh...So no soccer?	3
Duke	
It's before the 2nd half, and Duke is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.	
We should at least put up a fight so that they remember us.	1
There's nothing we can really do. Let's just get this over with.	
Don't give up until the end.	3
Duke	
With a serious face, Duke is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give him an answer.	
Being together is enough for me.	3
A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?	
Well, I'm sure we'll get an answer when we get to the end of this.	1
Duke	
Duke is having trouble deciding a name for his special move. His options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.	
I'm sure you're going to become an intergalactive fool.	
I..Respect your naming taste...	-1
Cool! Keep it up!	1
Duke	
The team is having a good run and Duke is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.	
Let's keep this momentum going!	
As long as we're not used as training material...	-1
There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.	1
Duke	
On a day off, Duke is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.	
I'd love to have a stable job first.	
It's really hard to find the right person.	1
If you find a beautiful woman, try talking to her!	1
Duke	
You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.	
If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.	1
I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.	3
Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.	
Duke	
Duke seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. He seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?	
It's within our grasp.	3
I would like to hear what you think is the best team in the universe.	
Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter.	
Duke	
Duke is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?	
(I want everyday to be exicting and fun.)	
(I just don't want to waste a single day in my life.)	3
(I want my dreams to come true.)	-1
Duke	
Duke is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.	
This needs to be analyzed and fixed. Can you help me?	3
Passes that you prefer aren't always the right answer.	
It can't be perfect every time.	
Duke	
Duke seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.	
Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.	-1
Maybe if you increase your strength...	1
Don't be weak.	3
Duke	
Duke's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next match. What should we say to him?	
If you keep it up like that you'd  be able to play superbly in any position.	
Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.	3
Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.	
Duke	
Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?	
The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!	3
Has he gone mad?	-1
I guess he's happy this is a good match.	1
Duke	
Duke plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.	
I'm thinking of opening a shop.	
We'll see about it after the League.	-1
I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.	
Duke	
The team is saying bad things about Duke for skipping practice. Time to intervene.	
Do you really think that he would skip practice?	3
Skipping practice isnt' something that's in his dictinoary.	
Hi slove towards soccer is real.	-1
Duke	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Duke is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously. 	3
He's obviously obsessed with soccer. 	
This is good. We can use this chance to break their backline.	1
Duke	
Duke seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.	
The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.	1
Let's open up a bright future with this ball.	3
Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)	
Duke	
Duke seems to be lost after having a good match while his fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to him.	
They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.	
It's just a myth. Forget about it	
Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.	3
Duke	
Duke is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.	
They're on coolcown.	
They support us from the shadows.	1
Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?	3
Duke	
Duke is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to him.	
It's silly of you to worry about such things. Are you feeling okay?	-1
We must have faith in the Gate Keepers and win the Galaxy League.	3
A mysterious villain...Bad taste, if you ask me.	1
Duke	
Duke is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to him.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	3
I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.	1
Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.	1
Duke	
Duke came to you after the match, and says he's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	
Let's work up a solution	
I'm disappointed, too.Let's start over.	3
Just please go with that boring strategy.	-1
Duke	
Duke is making a scene. He'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.	
Vicious? More like ugly.	
The door's over there.	
Are you giving up before putting up a fight?	3
Duke	
Duke is confused that he won the MVP. What should you tell him?	
Nicely done! We're throwing a party today!	-1
You deserve it. Well done!	3
Aren't you satisfied with your performance?	1
Duke	
Duke is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?	
I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.	
All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.	1
I can tell that he's a very dilligent person that always tries his best.	3
Duke	
Duke is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Iron Canyon.	
I want one of those. I'tll be fun to have a pet dragon.	
I can feel the strength of that majestic creature.	3
Hmm.....  If only I could change the shape of the horns and the color of the scales.  That'd be perfect.	
Duke	
Duke is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.	
I would've tried to find something that fits me.	
Something full of excitement!	
I would've been doing something to save the universe.	3
Duke	
Duke is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...	
I have very specific standards for perosnality, looks, values, and background.  Are you interested in hearing about it?	
I'm all about the feeling.  A spark is all it takes.	
I think that being able to understand each other is the most important.	3
Duke	
It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Duke and talk about what to do.	
We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.	3
I hope they have a "Continue" button around here.	
Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.	
Duke	
Duke is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop him from causing any problems.	
You're right. This is a waste of time.	
The honor of our opponent is also important.	3
That team is far from your style.	1
Duke	
You forgot to lock Duke and almost used him as training material! He looks very upset!	
It's my fault.	3
It was all just to motivate you to become a better player!	
It's your fault.	
Duke	
Duke seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to him.	
Everybody should grow up.	
It'll be alright. Don't worry.	
Let's go look for him.	3
Duke	
Duke is asking about the team's goal of this season. What should you tell him?	
To win all the way, of course.	-1
Best of 4 should be our goal.	
Teamwork is what matters the most.	
Duke	
During a match, Duke bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep on going.	
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.	3
Duke	
Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give him some advice.	
Is winning really worth going that far?	
I don't see anything wrong as long as you can get away with it.	
Be true to yourself.	3
	
Virgil	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Virgil asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel like I can fly" or something?	3
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	1
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	-1
Virgil	
Virgil seems to be curious about Bora's covered eye. What should we answer?	
I don't know much about her, but she looks strong.	-1
The eyepatch...I wonder if she washes it. She seems to have it on all times.	3
That's dangerous secret you're trying to find out. Do you still want to know?	-1
Virgil	
Virgil is suddenly showing massive improvement in his performance. He must've learned something during a match.	
Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!	1
You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.	
I knew this day would come.	
Virgil	
It's a very intense match and Virgil falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Virgil up and the two exchange smiles.	
Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?	3
True sportsmanship is Wonderful!	-1
That player must have a heart of gold.	-1
Virgil	
Virgil is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help him?	
It's the place where the chosen ones learn about their destiny.	-1
It's the place of dreams colliding.	1
It's stressful because we can't prepare for extraterrestrial sanitation. We're completely exposed to these unknown... things.	3
Virgil	
Virgil picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.	
So, this is how the revelation begins!	
Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...	
Let's contact her and return this.	3
Virgil	
Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.	
Well, now what?	3
Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?	-1
A crow?!	
Virgil	
Virgil is saying that his teammates are what keeps him going.	
(Put your thumbs up, wink, and send a juicy smile.)	
(Pat him on the head.)	-1
(Just nod your head.)	3
Virgil	
You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.	
...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...	
Ugh...I want to dig my eyes out.	3
Fontus...You sure are my archnemesis!	
Virgil	
Virgil was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin himself. Let's talk to him.	
Oh, that'll be so cute!	
It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!	
We can play soccer with the penguins!	-1
Virgil	
Virgil is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to him.	
I hope this won't affect your performance on the field. 	3
The fans love your performance!	-1
Should've practiced that autograph like I told you. 	-1
Virgil	
Virgil says that the Swirlies are missing.	
They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.	
They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.	
I evolved them.	3
Virgil	
Virgil thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.	
That's because you haven't opened up your "third eye"!	
Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?	
Hmm, her tail is a bit weird and her ears are definitely human...	3
Virgil	
Virgil says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.	
Hmm, a revived person that forgot his purpose... Reminds me of somebody.	
He'll remember someday.	
That's bad. I'm sure it's something important!	3
Virgil	
Virgil suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.	-1
How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.	3
Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!	-1
Virgil	
The crowd is cheering for Virgil. Virgil seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help him out.	
They're all in love with your enthusiastic play.	1
They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.	-1
How about just accepting the compliments for today?	3
Virgil	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Virgil having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match	1
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors,  paper?	-1
I see two idiots standing in front of me.	3
Virgil	
A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Virgil.	
I feel like he's mocking us!	1
It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.	
He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.	3
Virgil	
Ogre's pony tail slapped Virgil in the face!	
Even his hair is a weapon! Is that even allowed?	-1
That must hurt.	1
Ugh...Gross...	
Virgil	
The rain has messed up the field and the enemy team seems to be determined to crush your team.	
I can't stand this...I need to end this quickly and go take a shower.	3
What a depressing weather...	
Well, if it's a muddy dog fight they want, let's give it to them!	
Virgil	
Virgil falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to him?	
If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.	3
Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!	-1
Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.	-1
Virgil	
Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Virgil is curious and wants to take a look.	
We should probably ignore them and just walk by.	3
Let's go help them!	-1
They must love volunteer work.	
Virgil	
It's a throwing chance, but the opponent team player suddenly jumps in joy saying his baby brother is born. What should you do?	
I could throw the ball and continue the match, but my honor wouldn't allow that.	3
I guess I finally get to meet my archnemesis.	-1
Wow, congratulations! (Claps)	1
Virgil	
This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?	
Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.	
I heard that the bath products on Earth are the best in the universe.	3
I'm going to check out the new comic issues. Wanna come along?	
Virgil	
Virgil is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to him.	
Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.	-1
It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy! This is nonsense!	3
We haven't awakened our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyond!	-1
Virgil	
Virgil scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate him!	
Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?	
That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!	3
You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!	
Virgil	
Virgil brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drink looks really scary... But we can't just throw it away...	
Throw it away. NOW.	3
Drink it up!	
Virgil	
Virgil is impressed by the help he received from the elementals. Let's talk to him.	
The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.	3
I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!	
I am so thankful to them.	-1
Virgil	
Virgil is irritated because her opponent has the attribute advantage over her.	
It's not even a rainbow swirly match. Let's just play for now.	1
Do I have to stop the match?	3
It's time, Virgil! Awaken the 6th attribute and show your true powers!	-1
Virgil	
The team will not have a match for some time. Virgil asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.	1
Hmm, wanna go shopping?	-1
I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.	3
Virgil	
You come across Sammy while walking the street with Virgil. Let's talk to her.	
We'll win next time!	-1
Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.	1
(Ignore.)	3
Virgil	
Virgil lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good...Can anybody give him some heals?	1
Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...	3
I will avenge you!	
Virgil	
As Virgil said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to him.	
I`m sure it`s going in a good direction.	-1
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	
It`s not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	1
Virgil	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	3
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	
Virgil	
Virgil is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became his life. Let's talk with him.	
Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!	1
Life, eh? I guess that's a bit too serious for me, but I think I understand how you feel.	3
And that's how we walk towards our destiny.	-1
Virgil	
Virgil is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give him an opinion.	
This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!	1
Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!	
How about some presents for your parents?	3
Virgil	
Virgil wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?	
Perfect planning and perfect execution.	
All goes as planned... Hmm? Just ignore that.	-1
Why don't you join them and find out?	
	
Hiro	
Hiro is thinking about what the Universe of Oblivion is.	
Don't be scared about such petty things.	
I don't like the word oblivion.	3
I don't care as long as it doesn't harm me.	
Hiro	
Mortor and Wizol of the Peacemakers are helping an old man. Hiro seems to be surprised.	
Well what do you know! They have some decency in them after all.	3
Hmmm.	-1
It's good to know you're not shallow people. 	1
Hiro	
Hiro lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good...Can anybody give him some heals?	
Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...	1
I will avenge you!	3
Hiro	
As Hiro said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to him.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction. 	
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos. 	
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones leading the fate of this universe.	3

The team will not have a match for some time. Hiro asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match	3

I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody	1
Hiro	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Hiro having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match	3
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors,  paper?	
I see two idiots standing in front of me.	
Hiro	
Hiro has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. He is asking for your evaluation on his plays. Let's give him an answer.	
You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.	
Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it. You should keep that going.	3
I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.	
Hiro	
A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Hiro.	
I feel like he's mocking us!	3
It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.	
He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.	1
Hiro	
Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Hiro wants to say a word.	
Get yourselves together, guys. Are you going to give up already?	
Come on guys, you know it's an exciting thing to be playing against a strong team! Keep your heads up high!	3
They will be sacrificed for our victory and honor.	
Hiro	
You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.	
How can I earn gold? Where do I have to go to find the REAL Underground?	
It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.	
So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.	3
Hiro	
You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?	
I feel sorry, but that's irrelevant to the match.	3
 	
I'm considering making an anonymous donation.	1
Hiro	
Hiro scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate him!	
Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?	
That was awesome! I'm looking foward to seeing more of that!	1
You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!	
Hiro	
Hiro is saying that his teammates are what keeps him going.	
(Puts your thumbs up, wink, and send a juicy smile.)	3
(Pat him on the head.)	
(Just nod your head.)	
Hiro	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Hiro asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel I'm in heaven" or something?	
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	3
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	
Mikael	
Mikael is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?	
I don't think you need to worry about a diet.	1
You're playing soccer! You're fine!	
Please don't forget about the match.	
Mikael	
During a match, Mikael bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	-1
We have to keep on going.	1
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.	3
Mikael	
Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?	
The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!	3
Has he gone mad?	
I guess he's happy this is a good match.	
Mikael	
The team is having a good run and Mikael is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.	
Let's keep this momentum going!	3
As long as we're not used as training material...	
There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.	
Mikael	
Mikael looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to him?	
Where do you think those comets are going?	1
Do you think any of those comets are populated?	
The space has prepared this beatiful stage for you.	
Mikael	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Mikael is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously. 	3
He's obviously obsessed with soccer. 	
This is good. We can use this chance to break their backline.	
Mikael	
Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Mikael seems to be troubled. What should we do?	
If you guys keep giving Mikael trouble, I swear to god I'll use you both as special training material.	1
If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?	
You both need to be disciplined by Mikael.	
Mikael	
Mikael says he's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give him an answer.	
They're young but they have passion.	-1
Yeah, I mean they could get hurt.	
Teach them how adults play soccer.	
Mikael	
Mikael says that he thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give him an answer.	
That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy, love.	3
I think she likes him.	
Maybe she's up to something.	
Mikael	
Mikael is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to him.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	3
i feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.	
Use this as a chance to enhance your condition	1
Mikael	
Mikael is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.	
Do you think they'll be tasty?	3
I think they're cute and elegant if you leave out the pig and bear.	
I'd like to keep one as a pet.	
Mikael	
You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Mikael hands you a present.	
(A cute and pretty pendant)	1
(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)	
(A chocker with a pretty radical design.)	
	
Milky Way	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Milky Way asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel like I can fly" or something?	-1
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	3
Milky Way	
The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Milky Way and her opponent isn't over yet.	
You better win that fight!	-1
Hey! The match is over!	3
I've never seen her worked up that much.	1
Milky Way	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Milky Way having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match.	
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?	3
..I see two idiots standing in front of me..	-1
Milky Way	
Milky Way is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.	
Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes.  You're a precious part of this team.	3
Don't be anxious.  Have faith and keep following me.	1
That's why I need your help.	
Milky Way	
A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Milky Way. What should you say?	
Well, Milky Way does have that kind of charm.	
Well, you're as cute as Milky Way.	3
I hope you two become good rivals.	
Milky Way	
The crowd is cheering for Milky Way. Milky Way seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.	
They're all in love with your enthusiastic play.	1
They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.	3
How about just accepting the compliments for today.	
Milky Way	
You come across Milky Way who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?	
I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.	3
Trust me and your teammates. Sit this one out.	1
Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.	1
Milky Way	
You come across Sammy while walking the street with Milky Way. Let's talk to her.	
We'll win next time!	
Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.	3
(Ignore.)	
Milky Way	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	3
Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.	1
Let's give them a hand.	-1
Milky Way	
Latios is chatting with Milky Way after the match. Let's barge in.	
Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's our pretty girl.	3
Milky Way was fantastic on the field, right?	1
I'm looking forward to our next match!	1
Milky Way	
Milky Way is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.	
The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.	
I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!	1
I'm so thankful to them.	3
Milky Way	
Milky Way is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.	
I'm afraid to be honest.	
I was always looking foward for that moment.	-1
Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes, will you?	
Milky Way	
The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?	
Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.	3
We didn't play dirty, right?	
They will never learn with an attitude like that.	1
Milky Way	
Milky Way is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?	
You can overcome this like always. Right?	-1
It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.	3
Let's solve the problems one by one.	1
Milky Way	
A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Milky Way.	
I feel like he's mocking us!	-1
It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up	3
He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.	1
Milky Way	
Milky Way brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drink looks really scary... But we can't just throw it away...	3
Throw it away. NOW.	
Drink it up!	
Milky Way	
Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Milky Way.	
I think he felt better because of the positive energy you always have around you.	1
Maybe he got embarrased for being obsessed with his past?	
You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.	
Milky Way	
Milky Way was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.	
Oh, that'll be so cute!	3
It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up... Make 'em into a good meal!	
We can play soccer with the penguins!	1
Milky Way	
Milky Way is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.	
I'll sleep by your side tonight.	3
I see. We must be careful. I'll be watching over you.	
It's just a dream. Forget about it.	
Milky Way	
Milky Way scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!	
Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?	3

How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.	
Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!	1
Milky Way	
Milky Way is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?	
Don't worry about me! Do your job!	1
Can you peel this guy off of me?	
Don't come over here! It's dangerous!	3
Milky Way	
As Milky Way said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	3
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	
Milky Way	
The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Milky Way do?	
(Give her instructions so that she can do her share of the cleaning quickly.)	1
(Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely)	-1
(Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.)	3
Milky Way	
Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Milky Way is curious and wants to take a look.	
We should probably ignore them and just walk by.	
Let's go help them!	1
The must love volunteer work!	3
Milky Way	
You're watching the storm with Milky Way and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.	
Is something troubling her? I'm having a bad feeling.	
What's wrong with her?	
She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!	3
Milky Way	
Milky Way looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.	
Did you prepare your meds in case you got space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.	3
Don't worry. Leave it up to me.	1
Littre will be fine.	-1
Milky Way	
Milky Way lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?	3
Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...	1
I will avenge you!	
Milky Way	
You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.	
Can't you cook ramen by yourself?	
Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.	3
Is Marilyn your mother or nanny?	1
Milky Way	
Milky Way falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?	
If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's ok.	-1
Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!	-1
Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.	3

Milky Way	
Milky Way's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Milky Way seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.	
That player is just messing with you.	
I think that player likes you.	3
You're doing fine.  Don't play your opponent's game.	
Milky Way	
Milky Way is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.	
I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.	-1
The fans love your performance!	1
Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.	3
Milky Way	
You come across Milky Way being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.	
Are you feeling alright?	
Don't use that ability on the field...	3
Don't worry, I'lll go with you.	1
Milky Way	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	3
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	-1
Milky Way	
Milky Way seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.	
It's thanks to you! Thanks for listening to my instructions!	
I'm starting to see true strength in this team.	
Perfect! No mistakes made!	3
Milky Way	
It's a very intense match and Milky Way falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Milky Way up and the two exchange smiles.	
Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?	
True sportsmanship is Wonderful!	1
That player must have a heart of gold.	3
Milky Way	
The team will not have a match for some time. Milky Way asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.	
Hmm, wanna go shopping?	3
I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.	
	
Kei	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Kei some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	
Make him know who he's up against.	3
Let's try out some forward passes.	
Kei	
Kei comes to you and says that he has to leave the team because of personal reasons. What should we say?	
Well, I don't want to be the one holding you back. Good luck!	3
There will always be a place for you to return.	
So, how does this work? Do I tap "Sell"?	
Kei	
You got a couple of tickets to Veronica's live concert. Kei seems to be interested.	
These are for you, of course. Here.	3
We're going to make it fair and gather everyone around so we can draw for the ticket.	
I'll give you this, so get rid of that fake ticket.	
Kei	
Kei doesn't like the new team advertisement video.	
There's not enough fan service.	
It didn't portray your awesome performance.	3
It didn't have to have the bench warmers in the video.	
Kei	
It's Kei's birthday. Let's give him a present.	
Here! I made some cookies with the team.	1
I stole this treasure box from Kuma.	
This is a championship trophy replica for you.  The designs are inspired by you.	3
Kei	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	
Stop right there, pig!	
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	3
Kei	
James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.	
...We should get out of here.	
...It's about to go down...! Where's the popcorn?	-1
James and Bora...Who's the villain?	3
Kei	
Kei is asking if you have a special person who you would like to share happy moments with. Let's give him an answer.	
I think that may be you.	3
Every teammate there by my side on the field is special.	1
My Nari dakimakura! She's the best idol in the universe and is super strong.	
Kei	
Kei, who is determined to make everything in his life, even his dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.	
It was an intense feeling as if I was gonig against the strongest team in the universe.	3
I've never dreamt about soccer.	
I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.	-1
Kei	
Kei is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.	
I'm sure there were multiple reasons on why the kingdom fell. It's sad to hear such stories.	1
So, is that king entering the Galaxy League?	
Pathetic... That is no king.	3
Kei	
Kei is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer him up?	
We'll find the ones that did this and use them as fertilizers.	3
It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.	
Who could've done such a hideous thing?	
Kei	
Kei is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.	
It's all thanks to you.	3
It's a result of team effort.	
The opponents are mesmerized by the beauty of our players.	
Kei	
With a serious look on his face, Kei warns you to go to the bathroom before the match.	
Bathroom... It is indeed a very important matter...	
Why does an ordinary advice sound so strange..	
I'm surprised you said that. I won't ask what happened to you.	3
Kei	
Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Kei on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?	
You and I are already perfect. So I guess that means we shouldn't be saying our names. 	
I can't pick just one...	
I think it should be you, but will you be able to return to your normal life after all of this is...Wait, I'm going off topic, right? 	-1
Kei	
It seems that Kei is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?	
Listen carefully and you'll find him.	-1
Let's ask Khirel to find him...	
Kei? Nah, he never gets lost.	
Kei	
The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?	
Manga, anime, and figures...! Here I come!	-1
It's time for some good food.	
I guess I can go to the soccer gear shop.	
Kei	
You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Kei seems to be worried.	
Weakling. Should've been rougher on that player.	
It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.	
Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.	-1
	
Chitose	
Chitose is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?	
You can overcome this like always. Right?	
it's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off gaurd.	
Let's solve the problems one by one.	1
Chitose	
A teammate that is a former member of the Dark Sisters is down sick, suffering from the aftermath of performing exorcism. Let's talk with Chitose about what to do.	
Let's go visit her. Some fun won't do any harm. It might even cheer her up!	1
Let's leave her alone. She may find all this attention uncomfortable.	
Let's be prepared to take care of her in case her sickness gets worse.	
Chitose	
Chitose's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Chitose seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.	
That player is just messing with you.	
I think that player likes you.	
You're doing fine.  Don't play your opponent's game.	-1
Chitose	
Chitose is talking about how famous her rivals are in the Galaxy League. She seems jealous. Let's talk to her.	
You're as good as they are, I'd say you deserve more credit.	1
Good rivalry brings both sides to higher levels.	1
I'll be your rival from now.	
Chitose	
It's a tough match, but Chitose is standing tall and encouraging the team. What should we say to her?	
You really help us a lot in these situations.	
You're a good person.	
Your spirit is an inspiration to us all.	3
Chitose	
Chitose seems to be determined to crush the opposing team. Let's give her some advice.	
That's the spirit! Let's teach them a lesson!	3
With your skills and dedication, I have no doubt that you will.	1
I like how you're doing your best.	
Chitose	
You're watching the storm with Chitose and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.	
Is something troubling her? I'm having a bad feeling.	
What's wrong with her?	
She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!	3
Chitose	
You come across Chitose who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?	
I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.	
Trust me and your teammates. Sit this one out.	1
Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.	-1
Chitose	
Chitose refuses to listen to anybody's advice saying he's the best and he doesn't need any advice. Let's talk to her.	
Are you angry because I wasn't there to oversee your training? I said I'm sorry!	
Well that's absolutely fine if you can actually prove that you're the best.	1
That's not like you...	1
Chitose	
Latios is chatting with Chitose after the match. Let's barge in.	
Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's our pretty girl.	3
Chitose was fantastic on the field right?	
I'm looking forward to our next match!	
Chitose	
You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.	
Can't you cook ramen by yourself?	
Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.	3
Is Marilyn your mother or nanny?	
Chitose	
Chitose seems to be uncomfortable to hear about the love life of other teammates. Let's talk to her.	
It's all good as long as it doesn't affect the match.	
Should we join the club?	3
Just say it. You're jealous.	
Chitose	
Chitose, who has shown absolutely superb chemistry with you, is embarrassed and says she didn't do all of that because of you. What should we say?	
Stop being embarrassed and just accept the compliments, will you?	
Yeah? Well, I did what I did for you	3
Just say it. You're jealous.	
Chitose	
Chitose seems to be interested in the Micrinum from Kiri, which is said to be good for beauty and anti-aging. Let's talk to her.	
I think that's a good choice.	
Looks aren't important when it comes to soccer.	
You're young and good looking even without that.	3
Chitose	
You find Chitose depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.	
Don't mind it. It's our fault. We weren't able to make use of your strength.	-1
You did well and I thank you for that.	1
It's not your fault that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!	
Chitose	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	3
Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.	1
Let's give them a hand.	
Chitose	
Chitose seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.	
It's thanks to you! Thanks for listening to my instructions!	1
I'm starting to see true strength in this team.	1
Perfect! No mistakes made!	
Chitose	
You come across Chitose being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.	
Are you feeling alright?	
Don't use that ability on the field...	
Don't worry, I'lll go with you.	1
Chitose	
Chitose is interested in Selena and is asking for your opinion. What should we say?	
She's kind and sweet. Maybe you'll have a shot?	
Be honest and show a sincere attitude.	3
Considering your personality, I think she'll accept you.	-1
Chitose	
The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?	
Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.	
We didn't play dirty, right?	1
They will never learn with an attitude like that.	1
Chitose	
The team is at Metro City. Chitose seems to be surprised how the people of Metro City have mechanical bodies.	
I like how they don't mind physical flaws.	
I like how even the minority can be saved in this society.	
You have a heart of gold.	3
Chitose	
Kirin suddenly appears, pats Chitose on the head while teasing her, and then goes away. Chitose seems angry...	
He's like the wind. There wasn't even time to chat.	
...I think you liked it more than you thought...	3
Patting you on the head? He must not fear for his life!	
	
Amaranth	
With a serious face, Amaranth is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.	
Being together is enough for me.	-1
A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?	
Well, I'm sure we'll get an answer when we get to the end of this.	
Amaranth	
Amaranth plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.	
I'm thinking of opening a shop.	3
We'll see about it after the Leauge.	
I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.	-1
Amaranth	
You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Amaranth hands you a present.	
(A cute and pretty pendant)	3
(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)	
(A chocker with a pretty radical design.)	
Amaranth	
Amaranth is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?	
I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.	
All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.	
I can tell that he's a very dilligent person that always tries his best.	-1
Amaranth	
Amaranth went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?	
We should think about how to make fun of her when she comes back.	
I feel sorry for the other team.	
Amaranth is in danger! We have to save her!	3
Amaranth	
Amaranth looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?	
Where do you think those comets are going?	3
Do you think any of those comets are populated?	
The space has prepared this beatiful stage for you.	
Amaranth	
Amaranth seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.	
The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.	-1
Let's open up a bright future with this ball.	1
Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)	
Amaranth	
Amaranth is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?	
I don't think you need to worry about diets.	1
You're playing soccer! You're fine!	
Please don't forget about the match.	-1
Amaranth	
Amaranth seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see the problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.	
I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great.	1
Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!	
Amaranth	
It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Amaranth and talk about what to do.	
We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.	-1
I hope they have a "Continue" button around here.	
Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.	
	
Ruen	
You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Ruen hands you a present.	
(A cute and pretty pendant)	
(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)	3
(A chocker with a pretty radical design.)	
Ruen	
Ruen looks excited as she's talking with the team about pets. She turns around and asks you what kind of pet you like.	
I think that a baby duck following its mother is one of the most adorable things to watch.	
I like puppies. The loyal ones!	
I like cats. I like the egoistic side of them.	1
Ruen	
It suddenly began to rain heavily. You see Ruen running up ahead.	
(Catch up and share your umbrella.)	3
(Let her steal your umbrella.)	
(Run past her and smile.)	
Ruen	
Kuma is caught sneaking in the woman's locker room once again. We should talk with Ruen about what to do with him.	
Let's make him put on Ogre's underwear.	-1
Let's make him put on Renee's underwear.	
I'm not sure if it's save, but we can use him for leveling up.	
Ruen	
Ruen went to take a look at the opponent team and got caught. What should we do?	
We should think about how to make fun of her when she comes back.	
I feel sorry for the other team.	1
Ruen is in danger! We have to save her!	-1
Ruen	
Ruen is asking for special training sessions because she's not satisfied with today's performance. What should we tell her?	
Good. I'll train you until you can't stand up.	
If that's your wish.	
Sure. Let's get on to it.	1
Ruen	
Ruen did her best, but she failed to achieve the results she wanted and looks sad. We should say something to her.	
Sorry, I feel that this is on me.	
That wasn't enough! You have to try harder!	
It's experiences like this that bonds us together.	3
Ruen	
Ruen is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.	
Do you think they'll be tasty?	
I think they're cute and elegant if you leave out the pig and bear. 	1
I'd like to keep one as a pet. 	
Ruen	
Ruen is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?	
I don't think you need to worry about diets.	1
You're playing soccer! You're fine!	
Please don't forget about the match.	
Ruen	
Ruen is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle.	
You seem like the princess... Scratch that, the queen.	
She seems like a nice girl.	
It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.	3
Ruen	
Ruen is furious about the referee that's clearly favoring the other team. Should we stop her?	
(Step on the referee's foot and pretend it was an accident.)	
The tougher it gets, the better it feels to win. Right?	1
Ignore the referee. Focus on the match.	
Ruen	
Ruen looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?	
Where do you think those comets are going?	
Do you think any of those comets are populated?	
The space has prepared this beautiful stage for you.	-1
Ruen	
During the team meeting, you find a player sleeping. What should you do?	
(Leave it to Ruen.)	1
(Slap the player in the back of the head.)	
(Wake the player up and continue with the meeting.)	
Ruen	
Ruen seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.	
Be careful not to be stomped on...	
We can do this! Let's go!	1
Don't be nervous! Don0t you trust your teammates?	
Ruen	
It's dinner time and Ruen is staring at her carrot soup with a troubled look. What should we do?	
(Eat it instead of her).	
(Tell her to put the carrots in the soup on Hildegard's plate)	-1
(Tell her that carrots are good for the body and to eat it all)	
Ruen	
Ruen wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.	
Beginner level monster in an RPG Game.	
Thankful beings that will be our +160.	1
I'm planning to make a whole line of merchandise with them as the character.	
	
Silla	
Silla is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.	
He's just material for leveling up.	-1
I like how all Gate Keepers have different characteristics.	3
That bear...Is a hero...!	-1
Silla	
Silla is getting slow on the field and this is causing trouble. Let's talk with Silla.	
I think we should come up with an action speed deck or go for counterattacks...	
I'll try to have the ball come your way.	
We can overcome this with team effort	3
Silla	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Silla asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel like I can fly" or something?	-1
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	1
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	3
Silla	
Silla is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.	
I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.	-1
The fans love your performance!	
Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.	3
Silla	
Silla is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.	
I'm sure there were multiple reasons on why the kingdom fell. It's sad to hear such stories.	3
So, is that king entereing the Galaxy League?	-1
Pathetic... That is no king.	
Silla	
The team will not have a match for some time. Silla asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.	-1
Hmm, wanna go shopping?	3
I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.	-1
Silla	
Silla falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?	
If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.	-1
Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!	-1
Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.	3
Silla	
It's a very intense match and Silla falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Silla up and the two exchange smiles.	
Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?	-1
True sportsmanship is Wonderful!	1
That player must have a heart of gold.	3
Silla	
Silla scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!	
Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?	3
That was awesome! I'm looking forward to more of that!	-1
You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!	
Silla	
Silla is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.	
The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.	
I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!	
I am so thankful to them.	3
Silla	
Silla has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.	
You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.	-1
Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it. You should keep going.	-1
I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.	3
Silla	
Silla is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.	
(Put your thumbs up, wink, and send a juicy smile.)	1
(Pat her on the head.)	3
(Just nod your head.)	
Silla	
Silla says she wants to cry because the goal keeper on the other team just won't go down no matter how many shots she makes.	
Let's start by picking their defenses apart.	1
Let's come up with a new strategy to give you more synergy.	1
I'll come up with a formation that can bring the best out of everybody.	3
Silla	
Silla is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.	
It's all thanks to you.	1
It's a result of team effort.	3
The opponents are mesmerized by the beauty of our players.	-1
Silla	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	3
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	-1
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	-1
Silla	
Silla is asking if you have a special person who you would like to share happy moments with. Let's give her an answer.	
I think that may be you.	1
Every teammate there by my side on the field is special.	3
My Nari dakimakura! She's the best idol in the universe and is super strong.	
Silla	
Silla lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?	3
Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...	
I will avenge you!	
Silla	
Silla brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drinks really scary... But we can't just throw it away... 	3
Throw it away. NOW.	
Drink it up!	
Silla	
A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Silla.	
I feel like he's mocking us!	
It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.	3
He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.	1
Silla	
Silla suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.	3
How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.	
Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!	1
Silla	
Silla is having trouble focusing on the match. Let's help her out.	
I'll teach you how to meditate to synchronize the breathing with other teammates.	3
It's impossible to focus on a field with so many handsome me.	
Just calm down a bit. You got this.	
Silla	
Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Silla is curious and wants to take a look.	
We should probably ignore them and just walk by.	-1
Let's go help them!	1
The must love volunteer work!	3
Silla	
With a serious look on her face, Silla warns you to go to the bathroom before the match.	
Bathroom... It is indeed a very important matter...	3
Why does an ordinary advice sound so strange..	
I'm surprised you said that. I won't ask what happened to you.	
Silla	
You got a couple of tickets to Veronica's live concert. Silla seems to be interested.	
These are for you, of course. Here.	1
We're going to make it fair and gather everyone around so we can draw for the ticket.	3
I'll give you this, so get rid of that fake ticket.	
Silla	
You see Silla's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Silla. What should we do?	
She is probably not even listening...	
Let's see how long they last. Come on guys!	3
Tell me if you like her. Just say the words and I'll scout her.	
Silla	
As Silla said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	3
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	-1
Silla	
You find Silla being very excited after performing an awesome play. How will you react?	
Can't you do that more often?! (Cries)	-1
Nice play! Fantastic!	1
Now we're starting to look like a team!	3
Silla	
Silla doesn't like the new team advertisement video.	
There's not enough fan service.	
It didn't portray your awesome performance.	
It didn't have to have the bench warmers in the video.	3
Silla	
It's Silla's birthday. Let's give her a present.	
Here! I made some cookies with the team.	3
I stole this treasure box from Kuma.	
This is a championship trophy replica for you. The designs are inspired by you.	
Silla	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Silla having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match.	
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?	3
...I see two idiots standing in front of me...	-1
Silla	
Silla comes to you and says that she has to leave the team because of personal reasons. What should we say?	
Well, I don't want to be the one holding you back. Good luck!	
There will always be a place for you to return.	3
So, how does this work? Do I tap "Sell"?	
Silla	
Silla is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to her.	
I want you to form a team and catch every single bear near this locker room.	3
...If you want to say something, it's alright. I'll be listening.	-1
Let's go tell the manager.	1
Silla	
You hear that the opponent team's ace, who is also Silla's rival, has been severely injured and is in the hospital. What should you say to her?	
Sorry for the bad news.  Do you want to pay a visit?	3
This is our chance to steal his precious collection.	-1
This won't be the end of your rival.	
Silla	
The crowd is cheering for Silla. Silla seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.	
They're all in love with your enthusiastic play.	1
They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.	3
How about just accepting the compliments for today?	
Silla	
Silla is worried that she has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous things. What should we tell her?	
Look at the beautiful players! This is paradise!	
You're the most dangerous of them all.	-1
Makes it worth the challenge, don't you think so?	3
Silla	
You come across Sammy while walking the street with Silla. Let's talk to her.	
We'll win next time!	
Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.	3
(Ignore.)	
Silla	
The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?	
Manga, anime, and figures...! Here I come!	
It's time for some good food.	
I guess I can go to the soccer gear shop.	3
Silla	
After a meeting, Silla's eyes met yours a several times and Silla asks if she has something on her face.	
Yeah, Kuma's hat...	-1
I was just thinking the team became stronger, thanks to you.	1
I was just thinking about how much you do for the team.	
Silla	
Preparing for the press conference, you're talking with Silla on which player you think has the brightest future. What will you say?	
You and I are already perfect. So I guess that means we shouldn't be saying our names. 	1
I can't pick just one...	
I think it should be you, but will you be able to return to your normal life after all of this is...Wait, I'm going off topic, right?	
	
Net	
You come across Net being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to him.	
Are you feeling alright?	
Don't use that ability on the field...	
Don't worry, I'lll go with you.	-1
Net	
You visit Merlin's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.	
Can't you cook ramen by yourself?	3
Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.	
Is Marilyn your mother or nanny?	
	
Uriel	
It seems that Uriel is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?	
Listen carefully and you'll find her.	-1
Let's ask Khirel to find her...	
Uriel? Nah, she never gets lost.	
Uriel	
A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?	
I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!	-1
Don't kill him, okay?	
We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.	3
Uriel	
You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!	
Cool! Awesome!	
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	
...Uh...So no soccer?	3
Uriel	
Uriel says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.	
I think you two have something in common...	-1
Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.	3
Hmm? That is odd... What do you think about this?	1
Uriel	
The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?	
A square match is what suites a proud royalty.	
Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?	3
That has nothing to do with us.	
Uriel	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	3
Stop right there, pig!	
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	
Uriel	
During a match, Uriel bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep going.	
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.	3
Uriel	
Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Uriel seems to be sick of this.	
Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Uriel!	1
Iron Claw!	
Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)	
Uriel	
Uriel is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?	
I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.	
All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.	
I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.	3
Uriel	
With a serious face, Uriel is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.	
Being together is enough for me.	3
A way that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?	
Well, I'm sure we'll get answer when we get to the end of this.	
Uriel	
Uriel came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	
Let's work up a solution.	1
I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.	
Just please go with that boring strategy.	
Uriel	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Uriel is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.	
He's obviously obsessed with soccer.	
This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.	1
Uriel	
The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Uriel to set some simple rules.	
This team is a mess. Gather everybody on the field. I'll knock that spirit back into you guys if I have to.	
Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.	3
Come on, I'll show you the best spots around!	
Uriel	
Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?	
The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!	
Has he gone mad?	
I guess he's happy this is a good match.	1
Uriel	
Uriel seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.	
Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.	-1
Maybe if you increase your strength...	1
Don't be weak.	
Uriel	
Uriel's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?	
If you keep it up like that you'd  be able to play superbly in any position.	1
Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.	3
Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.	
Uriel	
Uriel is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?	
We'll find the ones that did this and use them as fertilizers.	
It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.	
Who could've done such a hideous thing?	1
Uriel	
You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Uriel seems to be worried.	
Weakling. Should've been rougher on that player.	
It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.	
Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.	1
Uriel	
Uriel seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.	
The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.	
Let's open up a bright future with this ball.	
Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)	-1
Uriel	
Uriel announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.	
You'll have to compete with me!	
I feel bad for the players that have to face you.	
I have faith in you.	3
Uriel	
Uriel, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.	
It was an intense feeling as if I was going against the strongest team in the universe.	1
I've never dreamt about soccer.	3
I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.	-1
Uriel	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Uriel some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	
Make him know who he's up against.	
Let's try out some forward passes.	3
Uriel	
Uriel came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.	
What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?	-1
I'm sure you got scammed.	
I hope that wasn't all you got.	
Uriel	
It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Uriel and talk about what to do.	
We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.	3
I hope they have a "Continue" button around here.	
Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.	
	
Latios	
You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Latios and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.	
Let's give her some space.	
I could really use some grilled sweet potatoes and chestnuts.	
There's no time for tears! Find who did this and bring justice!	-1
Latios	
You're talking to Latios about what you would do if the world ends tomorrow. Let's tell her your answer.	
I would say goodbye to all my friends.	3
If it's the end of the world, I'd pull of a crazy performance in a densely populated area before I go!	
Hmm, there's a guy I like to beat up before I die.	1
Latios	
Cracsus threatens to hack Latios's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?	
Let's blackmail Robin that we'll pluck out all of his plants.	
I contacted Hildegard.	1
Don't fall for this cheap shot.	
Latios	
Latios is thinking about what the Universe of Oblivion is.	
Don't be scared about such petty things.	1
I don't like the word oblivion.	
I don't care as long as it doesn't harm me.	
Latios	
Latios isn't pleased with the team's recent plays. She feels that the plays have become somewhat repetitive and dull.	
Let's all talk together and figure out what the problem is.	3
Let's invest some Crystals and get new players!	
We may have to go rough on the team and make them realize the problem. 	
Latios	
This was the worst game in your entire life...Latios comes to you to cheer you up.	
Please explain why you kicked the ball into our goal post, will you?	
Thanks... I know you're the one that's the most devastated... Let's do better next time.	
Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my feet.	3
	
Anael	
Anael says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.	
That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy, love.	3
I think she likes him.	
Maybe she's up to something.	
Anael	
Anael says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.	
It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry.	1
Did she think that you'll take over the throne?	
I sense that there's something she hasn't told us yet...	-1
Anael	
Anael wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.	
Beginner level monster in an RPG Game.	
Thankful beings that will be our +160.	3
I'm planning to make a whole line of merchandise with them as the character.	
Anael	
Anael seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.	
Be careful not to be stomped on...	3
We can do this! Lets go!	
Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?	
Anael	
Anael says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?	
Of course! Everyone is counting on you!	-1
Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.	
I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.	
Anael	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	3
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	
Anael	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Anael asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel like I can fly" or something?	3
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	-1
Anael	
Anael has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.	
You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.	
Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it.  You should keep that going.	
I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.	-1
Anael	
Anael is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.	
I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.	3
The fans love your performance!	
Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.	
Anael	
Anael is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.	
The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory.	
I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!	-1
I am so thankful to them.	
Anael	
Anael suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.	
How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.	3
Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!	
Anael	
Anael brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drink looks really scary... But we can't just throw it away...	
Throw it away. NOW.	
Drink it up!	-1
Anael	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Anael having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match.	
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?	
...I see two idiots standing in front of me...	3
Anael	
Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Anael seems to be troubled. What should we do?	
If you guys keep giving Anael trouble, I swear to god I'll use you both as special training material.	
If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?	
You both need to be disciplined by Anael.	3
	
Mariel	
There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?	
What's done is done. Let's come up with a new design.	1
It's finally time for some festival-soccer!	
Let's split up and find the uniforms.	3
Mariel	
You forgot to lock Mariel and almost used her as training material! She looks very upset!	
It's my fault.	3
It was all just to motivate you to become a better player!	
It's your fault.	
Mariel	
Mariel seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to her.	
Everybody should grow up.	
It'll be alright. Don't worry.	-1
Let's go look for her.	
Mariel	
During a match, Mariel bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep on going.	-1
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on youtself.	
Mariel	
Mariel is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.	
This needs to be analyzed and fixed. Can you help me?	3
Passes that you perfer aren't always the right answer.	
It can't be perfect every time.	
Mariel	
Mariel is asking you about the one thing you want the most in the universe. What do you tell him?	
(I want every day to be exciting and fun.)	
(I just don't want to waste a single day in my life.)	
(I want my dreams to come true.)	-1
Mariel	
Mariel seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.	
They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.	
It's just a myth. Forget about it	-1
Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.	-1
Mariel	
Mariel seems to be thinking that the team has already become the best in the universe. She seems a bit too carried away. What should you do?	
It's within our grasp	
I would like to hear what you think is the best team in the universe.	1
(Stick a thumb up and do a comedic dance just for the sake of laughter)	
Mariel	
It's before the 2nd half, and Mariel is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.	
We should at least put up a fight so that they remember us.	1
There's nothing we can really do. Let's just get this over with.	
Don't give up until the end.	
Mariel	
The team is having a good run and Mariel is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.	
Let's keep this momentum going!	1
As long as we're not used as training material...	
There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.	
Mariel	
Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some advice.	
Is winning really worth going that far?	
I don't see anthing wrong as long as you can get away with it.	-1
Be true to yourself.	
Leah	
Leah is worried about Vermilion Bird. She thinks something is troubling Vermilion Bird.	
Maybe this is something about love and hate. It may be something serious.	-1
Didn't she grow up being friends with the princess? I think I know what's going on...	
Maybe being the heir of an honorable family has its burdens.	
Leah	
Leah is having trouble finding a Spirit Stone that fits her needs and taste. Let's give her advice.	
How about Metatron's Will? It's cute with the butterfly decorations	3
I recommed the pure Paradise of Light	
What about Silient Cold? You'll be able to hold on to your oppoents	
 	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?	
It's the place where then chosen ones learn about their destiny.	-1
It's the place of dreams colliding.	
It's stressful because we can't prepare for extraterrestrial sanitation. We're completely exposed to all those unknown...things.	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman says she forgot to use her skill points before entering the match. What should we say to her?	
That's unacceptable!	
You can only find your true potential when you dont rely on your skills!	1
Well, we cant do anything about that right now.Let's focus more on passing the ball.	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle.	
You seem like the princess...Scratch that, the queen.	
She seems like a nice girl.	1
It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman	
Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.	
Well, now what?	1
Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?	
A crow?!	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?	
Where do you think those comets are going?	1
Do you think any of those comets are populated?	3
The space has prepared this beautifil stage for you.	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.	
Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!	3
Life, eh? I guess that's a bit too serious for me, but i think i understant how you feel.	
And that's how we walk towards our desiny.	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?	
Perfect planning and perfect execution	1
All goes as planned..Hmm?Just ignore that.	
Why don't you join them and find out?	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.	
So, this is how the revelation begins!	-1
Oh, i'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of curse...	3
Let's contact her and return this.	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.	
Impressive!You're the ace of this team now!	3
You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.	
I knew this day would come.	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.	
Tell them they should remember that they play for you	
Just hear them out and smile. They'll feel better.	3
You can point out their mistakes and flaws,but still keep things humorous.Just don't go too sarcastic on them.	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.	
Everybody is not at 100%. But,i think we'll do better sooner or later.	3
It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy!This is nonsense!	
We haven't awakened our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyond!	
	
Dynames	
Dynames wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. He wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to him.	
I'm surprised you care so much for your freinds.	
Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it significant.	-1
It's pretty exciting if we can stay the same even after 10 years.	
Dynames	
It's a tough match, but Dynames is standing tall and encouraging the team. What should we say to him?	
You really help us a lot in these situations.	-1
You're a good person.	
Your spirit is an inspiration to us all.	
	
Crocell	
Crocell is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.	
If you're better than your teammates then you should be the one to be considerate.	3
I'm not comfortable with this conversation.	
He can be irritating.	
Crocell	
Cracsus threatens to hack Crocell's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?	
Let's blackmail Robin that we'll pluck out all of his plants.	
I contacted Hildegard.	
Don't fall for this cheap shot.	1
	
Didi	
Didi looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to her?	
Where do you think those comets are going?	
Do you think any of those comets are populated?	
The space has prepared this beatiful stage for you.	1
Didi	
Didi wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.	
Beginner level monster in an RPG Game.	
Thankful beings that will be our +160.	-1
I'm planning to make a whole line of merchandise with them as the character.	
Didi	
Didi says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.	
They're young but they have passion.	1
Yeah, I mean they could get hurt.	
Teach them how adults play soccer.	
Didi	
Didi claims she saw Sophie of team Atlanta coming out of the men's room. What could be the case?	
She must've made a mistake.	
Maybe Sohpie is actually a male...?	1
I don't care what the case is.	
Didi	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Didi having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match	
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors,  paper?	3
...I see two idiots standing in front of me...	
	
Upiel	
Upiel is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.	
It's all thanks to you.	1
It's a result of team effort.	
The opponents are mesmerized by the beauty of our players.	
	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman	
Hyang Ran, the Shaman is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?	
I don't think you need to worry about diets.	1
You're playing soccer! You're fine!	
Please don't forget about the match.	
	
White Guardenia	
Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.	
The stage is so majestic! It's awesome!	
This proves that even the aliens like Nari.	
I think she's something more than just an idol.	-1
White Guardenia	
White Guardenia thinks she knows who Lynbell's brother is. What should we do?	
First, let's look for a way to bring him back to normal.	1
Of course we should tell Lynbell! What are you waiting for?	
...Sometimes, the truth is better to be left a secret.	3
White Guardenia	
According to White Guardenia's words, Tyler went to school 1 year earlier than William.	
I want to see Tyler's true characteristics.	-1
William doesn't know to respect his seniors.	
I thought they were just friends.	
White Guardenia	
White Guardenia came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	
Let's work up a solution.	3
I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.	
Just please go with that boring strategy.	
	
Tod	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Tod having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match	
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors,  paper?	
I see two idiots standing in front of me.	-1
Fizz	
Fizz says that the Swirlies are missing.	
They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.	
They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.	3
I evolved them.	
Fizz	
It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Fizz and talk about what to do.	
We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.	
I hope they have a "Continue" button around here.	-1
Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.	
Fizz	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Fizz is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously. 	1
He's obviously obsessed with soccer. 	
This is good. We can use this chance to break their backline.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Alice	
Alice is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.	
Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.	3
Well, having a good ace skill is a start.	
Flawless skills.	
Alice	
With a serious face, Alice is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.	
Being together is enough for me.	
Away that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?	1
Well,l'm sure we'll get an answer when we ge to the end of this.	
Alice	
Alice is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?	
I don't think you need to worry about a diet.	1
You're playing soccer! You're fine!	
Please don't forget about the match.	3
Alice	
Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Alice seems to be troubled. What should we do?	
If you guys keep giving Alice trouble, I swear to god I'll use you both as special training material.	
If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?	3
You both need to be disciplined by Alice.	-1
Alice	
Alice is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.	
Do you think they'll be tasty?	3
I think they're cute and elegant if you leave out the pig and bear.	
I'd like to keep one as a pet.	-1
Alice	
Alice says she's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.	
Is her name really Kiki?	3
Ask her if she likes you and if she wants to join our team.	-1
Tell her to be our lap cat.	-1
Alice	
Alice seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.	
Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.	
Maybe if you increase your strength...	1
Don't be weak.	3
Alice	
Alice seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.	
They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.	-1
It's just a myth. Forget about it.	1
Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.	3
Alice	
Alice is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.	
It's surprising to see such advanced technology.	
Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.	3
Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.	-1
Alice	
Alice seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell her?	
Congratulations! How did you guys get along?	1
Don't forget that we exist! Haha!	3
Good for you! I know it's hard for you to find someone at your level!	1
Alice	
Alice is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?	
I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.	-1
All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.	1
I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.	3
Alice	
Alice says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.	
They're young but they have passion.	1
Yeah, I mean they could get hurt.	
Teach them how adults play soccer.	3
Alice	
It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Alice and talk about what to do.	
We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.	3
I hope they have a "Continue" button around here.	-1
Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.	1
Alice	
Alice is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to her.	
Life is a light of its own.	
That's deep. I think it's cool.	3
How about we make it to the top of the Galaxy League and shine the universe with the light within us?	1
Alice	
Alice seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.	
The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.	
Let's open up a bright future with this ball.	3
Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)	-1
Alice	
You enter the lodging feeling lonely on your birthday. The team greets you with a surprise and Alice hands you a present.	
(A cute and pretty pendant)	1
(A surprise box! Inside it there's a cool wallet.)	3
(A chocker with a pretty radical design.)	
Alice	
Alice says that Bell seemed depressed when she told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.	
It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry.	3
Did she think that you'll take over the throne?	-1
I sense that there's something she hasn't told us yet...	
Alice	
Alice is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle.	
You seem like the princess...Scratch that, the queen.	-1
She seems like a nice girl.	
It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.	3
Alice	
Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?	
The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!	3
Has he gone mad?	
I guess he's happy this is a good match.	
Alice	
During a match, Alice bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep on going.	
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.	3
Alice	
Alice came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	
Let's work up a soluation.	
I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.	3
Just please go with that boring strategy.	
Alice	
Alice says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.	
Tell them they should remember that they play for you.	
Just hear them out and smile.They'll feel better.	
You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous.Just don't go too sarcastic on them.	3
Alice	
Alice plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.	
I'm thinking of opening a shop.	-1
We'll see about it after the League.	
I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.	3
Alice	
Alice wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.	
Beginner level monster in an RPG game.	3
Thankful beings that will be our+160.	1
I'm planing to make a whole line of merchandise with them as the character.	
Alice	
Alice seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.	
Be careful not to be stomped on...	-1
We can do this! Let's go!	1
Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?	
Alice	
Alice asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give her a sincere answer.	
I guess I'll be chasing you on the road of glory.	1
I want to see everybody smile. I think that'll make me happy.	
I'm going to make a joke before I start crying!	3
Alice	
Alice says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.	
Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.	3
That's strange.  I thought he was more of an authoritative character.	
Yeah, they get along pretty well.	-1
Alice	
The team is having a good run and Alice is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.	
Let's keep this momentum going!	3
As long as we're not used as training material...	
There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.	
Alice	
Alice is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	3
I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.	-1
Use this as a chacne to enhance your condition.	1
Alice	
Alice is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.	
They're on cooldown.	
They support us from the shadows.	
Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one.  Right?	3
Alice	
Alice says that she thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give her an answer.	
That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy, and love.	-1
I think she likes him.	-1
Maybe she's up to something.	
Alice	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Alice is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.	3
He's obviously obsessed with soccer.	
This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.	
Alice	
You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!	
Cool! Awesome!	
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	
...Uh...So no soccer?	3
Alice	
Alice says she's the center of the team and asks if you agree with her. How should we answer?	
Of course! Everyone is counting on you!	
Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.	3
I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.	
	
Alkyde	
Alkyde is asking for special training sessions because she's not satisfied with today's performance. What should we tell her?	
Good. I'll train you until you can't stand up. 	-1
If that's your wish.	
Sure. Let's get on to it.	-1
Alkyde	
Alkyde did her best, but she failed to achieve the results she wanted and looks sad. We should say something to her.	
Sorry, I feel this is on me.	
That wasn't enough! You have to try harder!	
It's experiences like this that bonds us together.	1
Alkyde	
Kaidormu of the United Explorers is praising Alkyde's plays. Let's add in.	
Be careful not to fall in love with her.	
Yeah, She's as charming as you!	3
You just got praised by Kaidormu! That's awesome!	1
Alkyde	
Alkyde is worried about Vermilion Bird. She thinks something is troubling Vermilion Bird.	
Maybe this is something about love and hate. It may be something serious.	-1
Didn't she grow up being friends with the princess?i think i know what's going on...	
Maybe being the heir of an honorable family has its burdens.	
Alkyde	
Alkyde continues to charge into the opponent's defense line and keeps failing. What should we do?	
(Make a strategic decision.)	
(Guide her by kicking the ball toward the weak link in the opponent's defense.)	3
(She looks happy. Let's let her be.)	
Alkyde	
It's dinner time and Alkyde is staring at her carrot soup with a troubled look. What should we do?	
(Eat it instead of her.)	
(Tell her to put the carrots in the soup on Hildegard's plate.)	-1
(Tell her that carrots are good for the body and to eat it all.)	-1
Alkyde	
Alkyde is thinking about how to resist the psychological and mental attacks that the demons enjoy using. Let's give her advice.	
How about you just go with the flow?	3
If they choose to attack you... Be careful.	
Maybe acting like a demon would help?	
Alkyde	
During the team meeting, you find a player sleeping. What should you do?	
(Leave it to Alkyde.)	
(Slap the player in the back of the head.)	-1
(Wake the player up and continue with the meeting.)	
Alkyde	
Alkyde heard stories about the world of the demons and asks what you think it'll be like.	
It'll sure be dangerous, but I think it'll be a place full of thrills and wonders.	3
Whatever you do, just pray not to confront team Nightmare.	
I guess you can make friends even in a place like that.	
Alkyde	
Alkyde is asking what it would be like to date an alien. Give her your opinion.	
I believe it'll be romantic.	3
I guess the platonic side would be important.	
I believe there was an old movie about an alien infiltrating a spaceship...	
Alkyde	
Alkyde is having trouble finding a Spirit Stone that fits her needs and taste. Let's give her advice.	
How about Metatron's Will? It's cute wth the butterfly decorations.	
I recommend the pure Paradise of Light.	-1
What about Silent Cold? You'll be able to hold onto your opponents.	-1
Alkyde	
Alkyde asks what your plans are for the holidays when there's no training or match. Give her an answer.	
(Spy on the teammates to see it they're doing anything funny.)	
(Stalk the person I secretly love to make sure she's not seeing anybody.)	
(Meet up with my lover.)	3
Alkyde	
It suddenly began to rain heavily. You see Alkyde running up ahead.	
(Catch up and share your umbrella.)	
(Let her steal your umbrella.)	3
(Run past her and smile.)	
Alkyde	
It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking up for the morning training. What should we tell Alkyde to do?	
They all need scolding.	-1
Wake them up. Kick them if you need to.	
(Step on everyone that's still sleeping.)	
Alkyde	
Alkyde looks excited as she's talking with the team about pets. She turns around and asks you what kind of pet you like.	
I think that a baby duck following its mother is one of the most adorable things to watch.	
I like puppies. The loyal ones!	
I like cats. I like the egoistic side of them.	-1
Alkyde	
You witnessed a player on the other side putting a tack in Alkyde's shoe.	
(Ignore it.)	
(Remove the tack and tell the manager on the other team.)	
(Tell Alkyde who did this.)	3
Alkyde	
Alkyde is furious about the referee that's clearly favoring the other team. Should we stop her?	
(Steps on the referee's foot and pretend it was an accident.)	3
The tougher it gets, the better it feels to win. Right?	
Ignore the referee. Focus on the match.	
Alkyde	
Alkyde feels her heart races when she sees Littre.	
...Do you want to spend the rest of your life being with an abusive herbivore like alien creature?	
...Do you want a Superb Power-up?	-1
...That's not a rabbit.	
Alkyde	
Kuma is caught sneaking in the woman's locker room once again. We should talk with Alkyde about what to do with him.	
Let's make him put on Ogre's underwear	3
Let's make him put on Alkyde's underwear	
I'm not sure if it's safe, but we can use him for leveling up.	
Alkyde	
Alkyde's uniform is all messed up because of the filthy plays of her opponent. What should we do?	
(Give her a new uniform.)	
(Tell her that it's not he opponent showing affection and it's nothing but foul plays.)	
(It won't be long until the opponent becomes mesmerized by Alkyde's charms.)	3
Alkyde	
The team became furious after seeing Alkyde fall by the focused attack of the opposing team and used that fury to win the game. Let's say something.	
You did well. Don't worry!	1
You can rely on your teammates in situations like this.	
Your beauty is a curse.	
Alkyde	
Being too excited, Alkyde is overreacting while talking about the game. It seems she wants people to agree with her.	
I've never seen you so excited! You did a great job out there!	1
You're excited only because you got the chance to shoot the ball without any restraints against that player you like.	
Yeah. The sight of you running on the field was marvelous.	
Alkyde	
{0} is criticizing the male teammates that were mesmerized by Lilith during the match. It's your job to defend your teammates.	
This could all be avoided if we become mesmerized by you. Do as you please.	
I think they're also mesmerized by you. You have a charm that matches a demon...	3
As pathetic as they are, let's let this one slide.	
	
Avnore	
You're sick and in bed when Avnore and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?	
You guys... I'm about to cry...	
I'm sorry... I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...	3
Get closer so I can spread my germs!	
Avnore	
MX54 Butcher is closing in on a cat with a suspicious smile.	
Stop right there!	
Excuse me, but do you have an appointment with that cat?	3
...Maybe he just likes cats!	1
Avnore	
Avnore is asking if you have a special person who you would like to share happy moments with. Let's give him an answer.	
I think that may be you.	
Every teammate there by my side on the field is special.	
My Nari dakimakura! She's the best idol in the universe and is super strong.	3
Avnore	
The team is going to go shop. Which group will you join?	
Manga, anime, and figures...! Here I come!	3
It's time for some good food.	
I guess I can go to the soccer gear shop.	
Avnore	
The team manger ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?	
We could start a reset marathon.	
We're going to hunt that manager down and take back our money. We will show no mercy!	
Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.	3
Avnore	
With a serious look on his face, Avnore warns you to go to the bathroom before the match.	
Bathroom...It is indeed a very important matter...	1
Why does an ordinary advice sound so strange...	3
I'm surprised you said that. I won't ask what happened to you.	-1
Avnore	
The match and the concert that Avnore was looking for start at the same time...	
Let's hack the big screen so we can see the concert!	1
Channel that sorrow and rage towards your opponents and make them pay.	
I'm sorry that you couldn't go.	3
Avnore	
You see Avnore's opponent trash talking and smirking towards Avnore. What should we do?	
He is probably not even listening...	
Let's see how long they last. Come on guys!	
Tell me if you like him. just say the word and I'll scout him.	3
Avnore	
Avnore is making a scene about the women's uniform and underwear disappearing. Let's talk to him.	
I want you to form a team and catch every single bear near this locker room	
If you want to say something, It's alright. I'll be listening.	3
Let's go tell the manager.	
Avnore	
You find Avnore being very excited after performing an awesome play. How will you react?	
Can't you do that more often?! (Cries)	
Nice play! Fantastic!	1
Now we're starting to look like a team!	-1
Avnore	
The match started and Avnore is standing still doing nothing.	
What is he doing? Is he a totem?	1
Run! Just start running!	
Looks like we'll have to do without him.	
Avnore	
Avnore is worried that he has to face demons, black holes and other dangerous things. What should we tell him?	
Look at the beautiful players! This is paradise!	3
You're the most dangerous of them all.	
Makes it worth the challenge, don't you think?	
Avnore	
Avnore is wondering why the team is doing so well recently. Pick an answer.	
It's all thanks to you.	
It's a result of team effort.	
The opponents are mesmerized by the beauty of our players.	3
Avnore	
Nari is dancing and singing a song about the galaxy.	
The stage is so majestic! It's awesome!	-1
This proves that even the aliens like Nari.	
I think she's something more than just an idol.	
Avnore	
This was the worst game in your entire life...Avnore comes to you to cheer you up.	
Please explain why you kicked the ball into our goal post, will you?	-1
Thanks...I know you're the one that's the most devastated...Let's do better next time.	1
Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my fee.	
Avnore	
Avnore is having trouble focusing on the match. Let's help him out.	
I'll teach you how to meditate to synchronize the breathing with other teammates.	
It's impossible to focus on a field with so many beautiful women.	3
Just calm down a bit. You got this.	
Avnore	
The opponent team barges into the field and mocks your team saying your team is better off playing foot volleyball.	
Let's see what you have to say after the match.	3
I didn't know I was a talented foot volleyball player!	
Care to receive the ball with your face?	
Avnore	
Avnore is telling a story about how an old kingdom in Valhalla was doomed because of the king.	
I'm sure there were multiple reasons on why the kingdom fell. It's sad to hear such stories.	
So, is that king entering the Galaxy League?	3
Pathetic... That is no king.	1
Avnore	
Avnore wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.	
Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.	
The character story left him a trauma.	
Maybe he just wants to duke out.	-1
Avnore	
Avnore is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give him some advice.	
I hope you get scouted by an interesting team.	1
Make the scouters fall in love with your performance!	
Let's make that our goal and make it happen,	
Avnore	
After a meeting, Avnore's eyes met yours a several times and Avnore asks if he has something on his face.	
Yeah, Kuma's hat...	
I was just thinking the team became stronger, thanks to you.	1
I was just thinking about how much you do for the team.	-1
Avnore	
Avnore is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to him.	
	
	
Aren't you the one everybody should be afraid of?	-1
Baltheon	
Baltheon caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?	
I think we should hang him.	-1
Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.	3
You came to see my marvelous moves? I'm flattered.	-1
Baltheon	
You find Baltheon lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?	
Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?	3
Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!	-1
Hmm, I guess you're more domestic than I thought.	
Baltheon	
The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Baltheon to set some simple rules.	
This team is a mess. Gather everybody on the field. I'll knock that spirit back into you guys if I have to.	-1
Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.	3
Come on, I'll show you the best spots around!	-1
Baltheon	
You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.	
If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.	3
I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.	1
Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.	
Baltheon	
Baltheon seems to be lost after having a good match while his fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to him.	
They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.	
It's just a myth. Forget about it.	3
Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.	1
Baltheon	
It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Baltheon and talk about what to do.	
We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.	-1
I hope they have a "Continue" button around here.	
Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.	3
Baltheon	
The team is having a good run and Baltheon is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.	
Let's keep this momentum going!	
As long as we're not used as training material...	
There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.	3
Baltheon	
Baltheon came to you after the match, and says he's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	
Let's work up a solution	3
I'm disappointed, too.Let's start over.	-1
Just please go with that boring strategy.	
Baltheon	
With a serious face, Baltheon is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give him an answer.	
Being together is enough for me.	
Away that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?	-1
Well,l'm sure we'll get an answer when we ge to the end of this.	3
Baltheon	
A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?	
I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!	-1
Don't kill him, okay?	-1
We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.	3
Baltheon	
Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?	
The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!	1
Has he gone mad?	
I guess he's happy this is a good match.	3
Baltheon	
Baltheon is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.	
Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.	
Well, having a good ace skill is a start.	
Flawless skills.	3
Baltheon	
Baltheon came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.	
What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?	
I'm sure you got scammed.	-1
I hope that wasn't all you got.	3
Baltheon	
Baltheon seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.	
The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.	3
Let's open up a bright future with this ball.	
Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)	-1
Baltheon	
Baltheon is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give him an answer.	
We need a decent level of personal performance.	3
What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?	-1
Wreck the other team.	
Baltheon	
James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.	
...We should get out of here.	3
...It's about to go down...! Where's the popcorn?	-1
James and Bora...Who's the villain?	
Baltheon	
Baltheon wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. He wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to him.	
I'm surprised you care so much for your friends.	
Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.	3
It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.	-1
Baltheon	
You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Baltheon seems to be worried.	
Weakling. Should've been rougher on that player.	
It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.	3
Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.	
Baltheon	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	3
Stop right there, pig!	
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	
Baltheon	
During a match, Baltheon bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep on going.	3
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.	1
Baltheon	
Baltheon is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to him?	
That doesn't change what we must do.	3
Come on, cheer up. You're not being yourself.	1
Stop whining. I like it better when you're arrogant and sarcastic.	
Baltheon	
You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!	
Cool! Awesome!	-1
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	3
...Uh...So no soccer?	1
Baltheon	
Baltheon, who is determined to make everything in his life, even his dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.	
It was an intense feeling as if I was going against the strongest team in the universe.	
I've never dreamt about soccer.	3
I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.	
Baltheon	
Baltheon is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer him up?	
We'll find the ones that did this and use them as fertilizers.	-1
It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.	3
Who could've done such a hideous thing?	1
Baltheon	
Baltheon is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to him.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	
I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.	
Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.	3
Baltheon	
Baltheon is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.	
It's surprising to see such advanced technology.	3
Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.	1
Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.	
Baltheon	
Baltheon says he doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. He thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.	
I think you two have something in common...	-1
Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.	3
Hmm? That is odd...What do you think about this?	1
Baltheon	
Baltheon seems to be lost. He says he no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.	3
I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great.	
Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!	
Baltheon	
Baltheon seems to be upset about losing a body check against his opponent.	
Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.	
Maybe if you increase your Strength...	3
Don't be weak.	1
Baltheon	
Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Baltheon seems to be sick of this.	
Okay! Now i'll tell you all the good stuff about Baltheon!	1
Iron Claw!	
Oh, there's Princess Merian! (Runs away)	3
Baltheon	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Baltheon is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.	1
He's obviously obsessed with soccer.	
This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.	3
Baltheon	
Baltheon wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?	
That seems like a dangerous idea... Let's not make any quick decisions.	3
What about just watching?	-1
Sure. Let's beat them all and take the prize money!	-1
Baltheon	
Baltheon is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?	
I head he's a super agent from Nebrion.	-1
All that i care is that he's an excellent trainer.	
I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.	1
Baltheon	
Baltheon's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next match. What should we say to him?	
If you keep it up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.	3
Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.	
Consumed a lot of Swirles, I see.	
Baltheon	
It seems that Baltheon is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?	
Listen carefully and you'll find him.	
Let's ask Khirel to find him...	
Baltheon? Nah, he never gets lost.	3
Baltheon	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Baltheon some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	-1
Make him know who he's up against.	-1
Let's try out some forward passes.	3
Baltheon	
Baltheon is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.	
Thery're on cooldown.	
They support us from the shadows.	3
Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?	
Baltheon	
Baltheon announces that he will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give him an answer.	
You'll have to complete with me!	-1
I feel bad for the players that have to face you.	
I have faith in you.	3
Baltheon	
Baltheon looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.	
It's space. Anything can exist here.	3
How about we ask Jeunese?	
Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.	-1
Baltheon	
Baltheon plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.	
I'm thinking of opening a shop.	
We'll see about it after the League.	3
I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.	-1
	
Dale	
Dale seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to him.	
Everybody should grow up.	3
It'll be alright. Don't worry.	
Let's go look for him.	
Dale	
Dale is arrogantly looking down at the other team. Let's stop him from causing any problems.	
You're right. This is a waste of time.	1
The honor of our opponent is also important.	-1
That team is far from your style.	
Dale	
A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Dale.	
I feel like he's mocking us!	3
It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.	
He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.	
Dale	
Dale suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.	
How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.	
Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!	3
Dale	
As Dale said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to him.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	-1
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	3
Dale	
Dale brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...	
Throw it away. NOW.	
Drink it up!	3
Dale	
Dale is confused that he won the MVP. What should you tell him?	
Nicely done! We're throwing a party today!	
You deserve it. Well Done!	
Aren't you satisfied with your performance?	3
Dale	
Dale was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin himself. Let's talk to him.	
Oh, that'll be so cute!	
It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up...Make 'em into a good meal!	1
We can play soccer with the penguins!	3
Dale	
Dale is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to him.	
I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.	
The fans love your performance!	
Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.	-1
Dale	
Dale is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to him.	
It's silly of you to worry about such things.  Are you feeling okay?	
We must have faith in the Gate Keepers and win the Galaxy League.	
A mysterious villian...Bad taste, if you ask me.	3
Dale	
Dale is talking with the team about what they would be doing if they didn't start soccer. Let's join them.	
I would've tried to find something that fits me.	3
Something full of excitement!	
I would've been doing something to save the universe.	
Dale	
Dale is having trouble deciding a name for his special move. His options are ''Infinity Illusion Shot'', ''11th Dimension Ultra Gravity Shot'', ''Astral Space Shot'', and a few more.	
I'm sure you're going to become an intergalactive fool.	
I..Respect your naming taste...	3
Cool! Keep it up!	-1
Dale	
Dale is complaining that it's boring to play only soccer every day. What should we say to him?	
How about we play baseball today?	-1
No,It's not boring.	1
If you're up for suggestion,I'm all ears.	3
Dale	
There's been a mistake. The team's uniform is mixed up with the festival costumes. What should you tell the team?	
What's done is done. Let's come up with a new design.	
It's finally time for some festival-soccer!	
Let's split up and find the uniforms.	1
Dale	
Dale lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good... Can anybody give him some heals?	
Well, this could all have been prevented if you consumed those Swirlies like I told you...	
I will avenge you!	3
Dale	
Dale is mesmerized by the majestic scenery of a dragon flying in the skies of the Iron Canyon.	
I want one of those. It'll be fun to have a pet dragon.	
I can feel the strength of that majestic creature.	
Hmm... If only I could change the shape of the horns and the color of the scales. That'd be perfect.	3
Gerrard	
Gerrard is questioning Kuma's status as a Gate Keeper.	
He's just material for leveing up.	3
I like how all of the gate Keepers have different characteristics,	
That bear...Is a hero...!	
Gerrard	
Gerrard brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...	
Throw it away. NOW.	-1
Drink it up!	
	
Jheet	
The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Jheet to set some simple rules.	
This team is a mess. Gather everybody on the field. I'll knock that spirit back into you guys if I have to.	-1
Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.	
Come on, I'll show you the best spots around!	
Jheet	
You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!	
Cool! Awesome!	
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	
...Uh...So no soccer?	3
Jheet	
Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Jheet seems to be sick of this.	
Okay! Now i'll tell you all the good stuff about Jheet!	1
Iron Claw!	
Oh, there's Princess Merian! (Runs away)	
Jheet	
Jheet is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.	
They're on cooldown.	
They support us from the shadows.	1
Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?	3
Jheet	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	
Stop right there, pig!	
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	-1

You find Jheet lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?	
Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner? 	3
Stop wandering around the kids snack corner! 	
Hmmm, I guess you're more domestic than I thought. 	1
Jheet	
It seems that Jheet is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?	
Listen carefully and you'll find him.	
Let's ask Khirel to find him...	
Baltheon? Nah, he never gets lost.	3
Jheet	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Jheet some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	
Make him know who he's up against.	
Let's try out some forward passes.	3
Jheet	
Jheet caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?

The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!	3
Has he gone mad?	
I guess he's happy this is a good match.	
Jheet	
During a match, Jheet bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep on going.	
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself.	3
Jheet	
Jheet is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer him up?	
We'll find the ones that did this and use them as fertilizers.	-1
It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.	
Who could've done such a hideous thing?	
	
Jeunese	
Jeunese picked up a diary. It says Bell on the cover.	
So, this is how the revelation begins!	-1
Oh, I'm sure going to read this! That's a joke, of course...	
Lets contact her and return this.	1
Jeunese	
You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.	
...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...	
Ugh...I want to dig my eyes out.	
Fontus...You sure are my archnemesis!	1
Jeunese	
Jeunese says that the Swirlies are missing.	
They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.	-1
They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.	
I evolved them.	1
Jeunese	
Jeunese seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.	
Be careful not to be stomped on...	
We can do this! Let's go!	
Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?	3
Jeunese	
Jeunese says that Bell seemed depressed when he told Bell that Minerva's throne is empty.	
It'll be better if you don't show her that you're sorry.	
Did she think that you'll take over the throne?	
I sense that there's something she hasn't told us yet...	1
Jeunese	
Jeunese looks excited to see a comet shower, which is a rare sight. What should we say to him?	
Where do you think those comets are going?	
Do you think any of those comets are populated?	
The space has prepared this beautiful stage for you.	
	
Lucid	
Lucid is teasing her opponent that is having a hard time chasing her. What should we do?	
What are you going to do when that player falls in love with you?	
Well, that player is kind of cute...	3
Stop goofing around and play the game.	
Lucid	
Lucid is thinking about how to resist the psychological and mental attacks that the demons enjoy using. Let's give her advice.	
How about you just go with the flow?	3
If they choose to attack you... Be careful.	
Maybe acting like a demon would help?	
Lucid	
The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Lucid and her opponent isn't over yet.	
You better win that fight.	3
Hey! The match is over!	
I've never seen her worked up before.	
Lucid	
Lucid is worried about Vermilion Bird. She thinks something is troubling Vermilion Bird.	
Maybe this is something about love and hate. It may be something serious.	
Didn't she grow up being friends with the princess? I think I know what's going on...	3
Maybe being the heir of an honorable family has its burdens.	
Lucid	
Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Lucid.	
I think he felt better because of the positive energy you always have around you.	1
Maybe he got embarassed for being obsessed with his past?	3
You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.	
Lucid	
You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.	
Can't you cook ramen by yourself?	
Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.	-1
Is Marilyn your mother or nanny?	1
Lucid	
Lucid is having trouble finding a Spirit Stone that fits her needs and taste. Let's give her advice.	
How about Metatron's Will? It's cute with the butterfly decorations.	3
I recommend the pure Paradise of Light.	
What about Silent Cold? You will be able to hold on to your opponents.	
Lucid	
You come across Lucid who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?	
I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field.  Please sit on the bench.	-1
Trust me and your teammates. Sit this one out.	-1
Don't push yourself too hard.  Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.	3
Lucid	
Recently, Lucid seems to enjoy chatting with Jin. She thinks Jin is funny. Let's talk with her.	
I can't believe he's still an active player even at that age.	
Oh how much I'd love to show you what his "true" form is like.	-1
I didn't know you were into old man.	
Lucid	
Lucid is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.	
I'll sleep by your side tonight.	-1
I see. We must be careful. I'll be watching over you.	-1
It's just a dream. Forget about it.	3
Lucid	
You find Lucid depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.	
Don't mind it. It's our fault. We weren't able to make use of your strength.	-1
You did well and I thank you for that.	3
It's not your fault that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!	
Lucid	
Lucid is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.	
Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes. You're a precious part of this team.	-1
Don't b e anxious. Have faith and keep following me.	
That's why I need your help.	3
Lucid	
Lucid is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.	
I'm afraid to be honest.	-1
I was always looking forward for that moment.	
Stay by my side and make sure i don't make any mistakes, will you?	1
Lucid	
The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Lucid do?	
(Give her instructions so that she can do her share of the cleaning quickly.)	
(Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)	3
(Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.)	
Lucid	
Lucid is asking about the whereabouts of a teammate that hasn't seen for quite a while. Let's give her an answer.	
You said you want to be with him...So I used him as material for your special training.	-1
I used him as training material so that he could be useful for you.	
I sold him. We were in need of Gold	
Lucid	
The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?	
Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.	-1
We didn't play dirty, right?	
They will never learn with an attitude like that.	3
Lucid	
Lucid seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.	
It's thanks to you! Thanks for listening to my instructions!	
I'm starting to see true strength in this team.	3
Perfect! No mistakes made!	
Lucid	
Lucid heard stories about the world of the demons and asks what you think it'll be like.	
It'll sure be dangerous, but I think it'll be a place full of thrills and wonders.	3
Whatever you do, just pray not to confront team Nightmare.	
I guess you can make friends even in a place like that.	
Lucid	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	
Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.	
Let's give them a hand.	3
Lucid	
Latios is chatting with Lucid after the match. Let's barge in.	
Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's out pretty girl.	-1
Lucid was fantastic on the field, right?	1
I'm looking forward to our next match!	
Lucid	
Lucid's uniform is all messed up because of the filthy plays of her opponent. What should we do?	
(Give her a new uniform.)	1
(Tell her that it's not the opponent showing affection and it's nothing but foul plays.)	
(It won't be long until the opponent becomes mesmerized by Lucid's charms.)	3
Lucid	
Being too excited, Lucid is overreacting while talking about the game. It seems she wants people to agree with her.	
I've never seen you so excited! You did a great job out there!	
You're excited only because you got the chance to shoot the ball without any restraints against that player you like.	
Yeah. The sight of you running on the field was marvelous.	3
Lucid	
The team became furious after seeing Lucid fall by the focused attack of the opposing team and used that fury to win the game. Let's say something.	
You did well. Don't worry!	
You can rely on your teammates in situations like this.	1
Your beauty is a curse.	
Lucid	
Lucid is criticizing the male teammates that were mesmerized by Lilith during the match. It's your job to defend your teammates.	
This could all be avoided if we become mesmerized by you. Do as you please.	
I think they're also mesmerized by you. You have a charm that matches a demon...	3
As pathetic as they are, let's let this one slide.	
Lucid	
Lucid, who seems to be interested in Eve, is asking your opinion about her. What should we tell her?	
I'm worried that you two may go around causing trouble if you two are together.	
Maybe she would be too much for you.	
Maybe you could become a couple if you really really like her.	1
	
Lucifer	
The team is having a good run and Lucifer is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.	
Let's keep this momentum going!	1
As long as we're not used as training material...	
There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.	
Lucifer	
You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!	
Cool! Awesome!	3
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	
...Uh...So no soccer?	
Lucifer	
Lucifer plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with him.	
I'm thinking of opening a shop.	3
We'll see about it after the Leauge.	
I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.	
Lucifer	
Lucifer seems to be lost after having a good match while his fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to him.	
They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.	
It's just a myth. Forget about it	-1
Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.	
Lucifer	
Lucifer looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.	
It's space. Anything can exist here.	3
How about we ask Jeunese?	
Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.	
Lucifer	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Lucifer some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	
Make him know who he's up against.	
Let's try out some forward passes.	3
	
Metatron	
You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.	
How can I earn gold? Where do I have to go to find the REAL Underground?	
It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.	
So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.	3
Metatron	
Metatron says to you that it was an honor to be able to play with you. Let's give her an answer.	
Let's do our best until the very end!	3
I never imagined that I'd be uesd like this.	
Don't fall for this cheap shot.I'm starting to enjoy playing with you.	-1
Metatron	
Cracsus threatens to hack Metatron's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?	
Let's blackmail Robin that we'll pluck out of his plants.	-1
I contacted Hildegard.	
Don't fall for this cheap shot.	3
Metatron	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	-1
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	-1
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	1
Metatron	
As Metatron said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	-1
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	3
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	
Metatron	
You come across Metatron, who was overwhelmed by her opponent throughout the game. Let's cheer her up.	
Those scumbags played dirty. Ugh, I'm angry!	3
I should step on that player's foot next time.	-1
I'm proud that you played your game and didn't descend to the opponent's level.	1
Metatron	
Metatron, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal who you really are. What should we answer?	
To become the strongest being in space! I shall tramp on everything that stands in my path!	-1
Just playing soccer, that's all.	
To bring justice with soccer. That's all.	3
Metatron	
Metatron suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.	
How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.	3
Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!	-1
Metatron	
Half of your team is injured because of an evil plot of your next opponent. What should we do?	
We will confront them fair and square, and win.	3
I'll go blow up their lodging.	-1
Pathetic. We'll show them that we're better in many ways.	-1
Metatron	
Metatron is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to her.	
I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.	3
The fans love your performance!	-1
Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.	-1
Metatron	
Metatron falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?	
If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.	3
Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!	-1
Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.	-1
Metatron	
Metatron is thinking about what Selena said about saving the galaxy if we win the Galaxy League.	
Then we should do our very best to win.	3
I can play along if there's something for me.	-1
It's not good to just believe what others say.	1
Metatron	
The crowd is cheering for Metatron. Metatron seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.	
They're all in love with your enthusiastic play.	1
They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.	-1
How about just accepting the compliments for today?	3
Metatron	
Lynia is cleaning the streets with the members of Jeneva Crew. Metatron is curious and wants to take a look.	
We should probably ignore them and just walk by.	3
Let's go help them!	-1
They must love volunteer work!	-1
Metatron	
It's a very intense match and Metatron falls on the ground, but a player on the other team helps Metatron up and the two exchange smiles.	
Guess the match isn't that tough for you, huh?	3
True sportsmanship! Wonderful!	-1
That player must have a heart of gold.	
Metatron	
The team will not have a match for some time. Metatron asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.	1
Hmm, wanna go shopping?	
I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.	3
Metatron	
Metatron points out that the time the men of Minerva died and the time the epidemic broke out in Metro City matches.	
I think that had something to do with dirty money.	
It would disgust me if that was the result of an evil plot.	
That's too convenient to be a coincidence.	3
Metatron	
Let's talk to Metatron who recently started to take interest in the world of angels.	
It's a place to rest for the good.	3
I'm sure it'd be full of hypocrites.	-1
I hope it's not a boring place.	
Metatron	
You visit the practice field of your next opponent and feel very sorry about their not-so-good financial situation. What should we do?	
I feel sorry, but that's irrelevant to the match.	3
This is going to be a cake walk.	-1
I'm considering making an anonymous donation.	
Metatron	
Mortor and Wizol of the Peacemakers are helping an old man. Metatron seems to be surprised.	
Well, what do you know! They have some decency in them after all.	3
Hmmm.	-1
It's good to know that they're not shallow people.	1
Metatron	
Metatron is impressed by the help she received from the elementals. Let's talk to her.	
The only problem is they take up a lot of space in the inventory.	3
I feel the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!	
I am so thankful to them.	
Metatron	
Metatron scored a hat trick and led the team to a complete victory! Congratulate her!	
Hmm? Didn't we win the game when we scored the first goal?	
That was awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing more of that!	3
You're starting to show the world your true potential! I'm impressed!	
Metatron	
You're having a conversation with Metatron about the power of Spirit Stones which is covered in secrets. Let's tell her what you think.	
I need a Spirit Stone that's as fancy as I am.	
I won't rely on Spirit Stones.	3
I would buy them all if I could.	1
Metatron	
Your team seems to be too worried about the next match against the all stars of Minerva. Metatron wants to say a word.	
Get yourselves together, guys. Are you going to give up already?	1
Come on guys, you know it's an exciting thing to be playing against a strong team! Keep your heads up high!	3
They will be sacrificed for our victory and honor.	
Metatron	
Metatron was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.	
Oh, that'll be so cute!	-1
It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up... Make 'em into a good meal!	3
We can play soccer with the penguins!	-1
Metatron	
A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Metatron.	
I feel like he's mocking us!	
It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.	
He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.	3
Metatron	
Metatron is saying that her teammates are what keeps her going.	
(Put your thumbs up, wink, and send a juicy smile.)	-1
(Pat her on the head.)	-1
(Just nod your head.)	3
Metatron	
Metatron is complaining about a teammate and is asking for your opinion.	
If you're better than your teammates, you sould be the one to be considerate.	-1
I'm not comfortable with this conversation.	3
He can be irritating.	-1
Metatron	
You come across Sammy while walking the street with Metatron. Let's talk to her.	
We'll win next time!	-1
Do you also do fortune telling? I think I'm in love.	-1
(Ignore.)	3
Metatron	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Metatron having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match.	-1
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?	-1
...I see two idiots standing in front of me...	3
Metatron	
Metatron lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good...Can anybody give her some heals?	
Well, this could all have been prevented if just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...	3
I will avenge you!	-1
Metatron	
Metatron brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drink looks really scary...But we can't just throw it away...	
Throw it away. NOW.	3
Drink it up!	-1
Metatron	
Metatron is asking you if you ever saw the World Tree. Let's tell her your thoughts.	
Let's not talk about anything irrelevant to the match.	-1
It's something I'd want to see again with a person I care.	3
It's nothing but a tree.	-1
Metatron	
Metatron has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.	
You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.	3
Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it. You should keep that going.	1
I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.	
Metatron	
Metatron is thinking about what the Universe of Oblivion is.	
Don't be scared about such petty things.	1
I don't like the word oblivion.	3
I don't care as long as it doesn't harm me.	-1
Metatron	
The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?	
A square match is what suites a proud royalty.	-1
Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?	3
That has nothing to do with us.	-1
Metatron	
The teammates are speaking highly of Metatron, saying she's a good role model. Let's add in.	
Thank you for doing whatever it takes to win.	-1
She shows dominance with elegance.	1
She's truly a role model to us all with her skills and attitude.	3
Metatron	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Metatron asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel like I can fly" or something?	3
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	1
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	-1
Metatron	
Metatron is yelling, ''Our will for soccer is guiding us to victory!''	
Not again...	-1
Let's do this! I'm at your disposal!	
I like what you just said.	3
Metatron	
Metatron looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.	
It's space. Anything can exist here.	3
How about we ask Jeunese?	
Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.	
Metatron	
A big fight broke out between an angel and a demon within the team. Metatron is asking for help.	
I'm going to pick sides of the one I like.	-1
I hope the demon didn't say anything stupid.	3
Maybe the angel said something irritating again.	-1
Metatron	
You find Metatron lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?	
Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?	3
Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!	
Hmm, i guess you're more domestic than i thought.	
Metatron	
It seems that Metatron is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?	
Listen carefully and you'll find her.	
Let's ask Khirel to find her...	
Metatron? Nah, she never gets lost.	3
Metatron	
A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?	
I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!	-1
Don't kill him, okay?	
We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.	
Metatron	
Metatron says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.	
I think you two have something in common...	-1
Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.	3
Hmm? That is odd...What do you think about this?	
	
Phil	
The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Phil and his opponent isn't over yet.	
You better win that fight	
Hey! The match is over!	1
I've never seen him worked up before	
Phil	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	
Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.	
Let's give them a hand.	3
Phil	
You visit Merlin's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.	
Can't you cook ramen by yourself?	3
Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.	
Is Marilyn your mother or nanny?	
Phil	
You come across Phil who is limping. He says it's nothing. What should we do?	
I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.	
Trust me and your teammates. Sit this one out.	
Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.	3
	
Presty	
You find Presty depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.	
Don´t mind it. It´s our fault. We weren´t able to make us of your strength.	-1
You did well and i thank you for that.	
It´s not your fault that you fell during the match. Don´t worry about it!	3
Presty	
It's early in the morning and there are players that are having trouble waking up for the morning training. What should we tell Presty to do?	
They all need scolding.	3
Wake them up. Kick them if you need to.	
(Step on everyone that's still sleeping.)	
Presty	
Kuma is caught sneaking in the woman's locker room once again. We should talk with Presty about what to do with him.	
Let's make him put on Ogre's underwear	-1
Let's make him put on Alkyde's underwear	
I'm not sure if it's safe, but we can use him for leveling up.	
Presty	
Presty continues to charge into the opponent's defense line and keeps failing. What should we do?	
(Make a strategic decision.)	
(Guide her by kicking the ball toward the weak link in the opponent's defense.)	1
(She looks happy. Let's let her be.)	
Presty	
Presty is asking you about what you like besides soccer.	
I like board games about war. I admire famous commanders.	3
Rugby, a sport of strength!	
Boxing. I like that feeling when I get hit by a punch.	-1
Presty	
Presty seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.	
It's thanks to you! Thanks for listening to me instructions!	
I'm starting to see the true stregth in this team.	
Perfect! No mistakes made!	3
Presty	
You come across Presty being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.	
Are you feeling alright?	1
Don't use that ability on the field...	
Don't worry, I'll go with you.	1
Presty	
The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Presty do?	
(Give her instructions so that she can do her share of the cleaning quickly.)	
(Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)	-1
(Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.)	
Presty	
Presty feels her heart races when she sees Littre.	
...Do you want to spend the rest of your life being with an abusive herbivore like alien creature?	
...Do you want a Superb Power-up?	3
...That's not a rabbit.	
Presty	
Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Presty is asking how she did in the match.	
You were picking the other team apart! It was awesome!	
It was pretty scary watching you so pleased with the rough plays of the opponents.	
You bring the best out of the team. Good work!	3
Presty	
Presty hurt her leg during the 1st half of the match, but she insists on playing. What should we tell her?	
Don't push yourself too hard. There are a lot of matches left.	3
Okay. You make them pay, understand?	
It seems as if pain is what keeps you going...	
Presty	
Presty is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.	
Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes.  You're a precious part of this team.	3
Don't be anxious.  Have faith and keep following me.	
That's why I need your help.	
Presty	
It's dinner time and Presty is staring at her carrot soup with a troubled look. What should we do?	
(Eat it instead of her.)	1
(Tell her to put the carrots in the soup on Hildegard's plate.)	
(Tell her that carrots are good for the body and to eat it all.)	
Presty	
You witnessed a player on the other side putting a tack in Presty's shoe.	
(Ignore it)	
(Remove the tack and tell the manager on the other team)	3
(Tell Presty who did this)	1
Presty	
Presty looks excited as she's talking with the team about pets. She turns around and asks you what kind of pet you like.	
I think that a baby duck following its mother is one of the most adorable things to watch.	3
I like puppies. The loyal ones!	1
I like cats. I like the egoistic side of them.	
Presty	
Presty is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.	
I'm afraid to be honest.	
I was always looking forward for that moment.	-1
Stay by my side and make sure i don't make any mistakes, will you?	3
Presty	
Presty blushes up and tells you that she's happy she can play soccer with you. What should we tell her?	
Me too. You're a good leader.	3
*Smiles bitterly*	
Hmm, I'll prepare a rougher match.	
Presty	
You come across Presty who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?	
I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.	3
Trust me and your teammates. Sit this one out.	1
Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.	
Presty	
Presty did her best, but she failed to achieve the results she wanted and looks sad. We should say something to her.	
Sorry, I feel this is on me.	
That wasn't enough! You have to try harder!	
It's experiences like this that bonds us together.	3
Presty	
You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.	
Can't you cook ramen by yourself?	
Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.	3
Is Marilyn your mother or nanny?	1
Presty	
Presty is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?	
Don't worry about me! Do your job!	1
Can you peel this guy off of me?	-1
Don't come over here! It's dangerous!	3
Presty	
Presty is furious about the referee that's clearly favoring the other team. Should we stop her?	
(Step on the referee's boot and pretend it was an accident)	-1
The tougher it gets, the better it feels to win. Right?	1
Ignore the referee. Focus on the match.	3
Presty	
Presty's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Presty seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.	
That player is just messing with you.	1
I think that player likes you.	3
You're doing fine. Don't play your opponent's game.	-1
Presty	
Latios is chatting with Presty after the match. Let's barge in.	
Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's out pretty girl.	3
Luka was fantastic on the field, right?	1
I'm looking forward to our next match!	
Presty	
You're watching the storm with Presty and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.	
Is something troubling her? I'm having a bad feeling.	
What's wrong with her?	
She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!	3
Presty	
Presty is being annoying with her offensive words. What should we do?	
(Slap her.)	
(Kick her out of the team if things can't be handled.)	3
(Ignore it.)	
Presty	
Presty looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.	
Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.	3
Don't worry. Leave it up to me.	
Littre will be fine.	
Presty	
It suddenly began to rain heavily. You see Presty running up ahead.	
(Catch up and share your umbrella.)	3
(Let her steal your umbrella.)	
(Run past her and smile.)	
Presty	
You come across Presty thinking about the value of soccer. What should we tell her?	
I'm sure you can find pleasure inside of the violence of the field.	-1
The field is a ground of hopes and dreams. Isn't that enough?	3
I feel something when I overpower my opponents on the field.	-1
Presty	
Presty is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?	
You can overcome this like always. Right?	-1
It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.	3
Let's solve the problems one by one.	1
Presty	
Presty is having trouble focusing on the match because of the affectionate emotion she feels. She says she must leave now to propose to her lover. What should we say?	
You don't need to be the one being dragged around.	
You will be happy, while that feeling lasts.	
Think about your teammates that are counting on you.	3
Presty	
Presty is asking for special training sessions because she's not satisfied with today's performance. What should we tell her?	
Good. I'll train you until you can't stand up. 	-1
If that's your wish.	
Sure. Let's get on to it.	1
Presty	
Presty says that the soup tastes funny. What should we do?	
It's fine. Eat up.	
Let's stay away from the soup, just in case.	3
We shouldn't throw away food. Let's give it to somebody else.	
Presty	
Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Presty.	
I think he felt better because of the positive energy you always have around you.	1
Maybe he got embarassed for being obsessed with his past?	
You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.	3
	
Ravian	
Ravian falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?	
If that's all you've got, just stay down. it's okay.	
Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!	-1
Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.	
Ravian	
Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?	
The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!	3
Has he gone mad?	-1
I guess he's happy this is a good match.	1
Ravian	
Ravian is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.	
They're on cooldown.	
They support us from the shadows.	1
Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?	
Ravian	
Ravian is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?	
I head he's a super agent from Nebrion.	
All that i care is that he's an excellent trainer.	
I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.	3
Ravian	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	3
Stop right there, pig!	
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	
Ravian	
Ravian seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.	
The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.	
Let's open up a bright future with this ball.	3
Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)	
Ravian	
The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Ravian to set some simple rules.	
This team is a mess. Gather everybody on the field. I'll knock that spirit back into you guys if I have to.	-1
Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy free time.	3
Come on, I'll show you the best spots around.	
Ravian	
It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Ravian and talk about what to do.	
We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.	3
I hope they have a "Continue" button around here.	
Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.	
Ravian	
Ravian seems to be lost. She says she no longer hates the rival team.	
I don't see a problem with it as long as it doesn't affect your performance on the field.	
I guess that's natural. The matches against them were great.	3
Is there someone on that team that you like? Go propose!	
Ravian	
Ravian came to you after the match, and says she's disappointed at the team's boring strategy. What should we say?	
Let's work up a solution.	1
I'm disappointed, too. Let's start over.	3
Just please go with that boring strategy.	
Ravian	
Ravian says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.	
I think you two have something in common...	
Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.	3
Hmm? That is odd...What do you think about this?	
Ravian	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Ravian is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.	3
He's obviously obsessed with soccer.	
This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.	1
Ravian	
Ravian, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.	
It was an intense feeling as if I was going against the strongest team in the universe.	1
I've never dreamt about soccer.	3
I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.	-1
Ravian	
Ravian announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.	
You'll have to compete with me!	
I feel bad for the players that have to face you.	
I have faith in you.	3
Ravian	
With a serious face, Ravian is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.	
Being together is enough for me.	3
Away that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?	
Well,l'm sure we'll get an answer when we ge to the end of this.	
Ravian	
Ravian is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?	
We'll find the ones that did this and use them as fertilizers.	-1
It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.	3
Who could've done such a hideous thing?	1
Ravian	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Ravian some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	
Make him know who he's up against.	-1
Let's try some forward passes.	
Ravian	
Ravian's form has been improving rapidly. She says she can't wait for the next match. What should we say to her?	
If you keep it up like that you'd be able to play superbly in any position.	
Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.	3
Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.	
Ravian	
Ravian wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?	
That seems like a dangerous idea... Let's not make any quick decisions.	3
What about just watching?	-1
Sure. Let's beat them all and take the prize money!	-1
Ravian	
Ravian is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.	
We need a decent level of personal performance.	3
What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?	
Wreck the other team.	1
Ravian	
Ravian is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.	
It's surprising to see such advanced technology.	
Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.	3
Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.	
Ravian	
It seems that Ravian is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?	
Listen carefully and you'll find her.	-1
Let's ask Khirel to find her...	
Ravian? Nah, she never gets lost.	3
Ravian	
You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.	
If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.	
I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.	3
Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.	
Ravian	
Ravian seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.	
They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.	
It's just a myth. Forget about it.	
Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune telling.	3
Ravian	
You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Ravian seems to be worried.	
Weakling. Should've been rougher on that player.	
It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.	3
Let's just go. That player will also feed uncomfortable if we keep standing here.	
Ravian	
The team is having a good run and Ravian is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.	
Let's keep this momentum going!	3
As long as we're not used as training material...	
There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.	1
Ravian	
Ravian plans to continue playing soccer even after the Galaxy League ends. Let's talk with her.	
I'm thinking of opening a shop.	
We'll see about it after the Leauge.	
I don't care what I do after the League as long as I get to continue playing soccer.	3
Ravian	
You find Ravian lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?	
Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?	3
Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!	
Hmm, I guess you're more domestic than I thought.	1
Ravian	
During a match, Ravian bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep on going. 	1
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself. 	3
Ravian	
You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!	
Cool! Awesome!	1
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	-1
...Uh...So no soccer?	3
Ravian	
A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?	
I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!	
Don't kill him, okay?	
We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.	3
Ravian	
Ravian was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.	
Oh, that'll be so cute!	-1
It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up... Make 'em into a good meal!	
We can play soccer with the penguins!	
Ravian	
Ravian is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.	
Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.	3
Well, having a good ace skill is a start.	
Flawless skills.	
Ravian	
Ravian looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.	
It's space. Anything can exist here.	3
How about we ask Jeunese?	
Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.	
Ravian	
Ravian seems to be upset about losing a body check against her opponent.	
Let's make an armor out of Spirit Stones.	-1
Maybe if you increase your Strength....	1
Don't be weak.	3
Ravian	
Ravian caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?	
I think we should hang him.	-1
Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.	3
You came to see my marvelous moves? I'm flattered.	
Ravian	
Ravian is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?	
That doesn't change what we must do.	3
Come on, cheer up.  You're not being yourself.	
Stop whining. I like it better when you're arrogant and sarcastic.	
Ravian	
As Ravian said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to her.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	-1
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	
Ravian	
Ravian is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	
I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.	-1
Use this as a chacne to enhance your condition.	1
Ravian	
Ravian wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.	
I'm surprised you care so much for your friends.	
Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.	3
It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.	
Ravian	
Ravian came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.	
What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?	-1
I'm sure you got scammed.	
I hope that wasn't all you got.	3
	
Serestia	
Serestia falls to the ground after clashing with the opponent. What should we say to her?	
If that's all you've got, just stay down. It's okay.	3
Get up! The game's not over! You better not give up!	
Well, let's start by dropping that player's HP to 1.	1
Serestia	
The team made it up to the semi-finals after counting the goal differences. Serestia asks how you feel. How should we answer?	
What, are you expecting something like "I feel like I can fly" or something?	
This is where things get serious. We're going for the win!	1
Wow. I'm sooooo happy.	
Serestia	
Serestia seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.	
They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.	
It's just a myth. Forget about it.	
Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune-telling.	1
Serestia	
Serestia has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. She is asking for your evaluation on her plays. Let's give her an answer.	
You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.	3
Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it. You should keep that going.	
I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.	
Serestia	
Serestia is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give her an answer.	
They're on cooldown.	
They support us from the shadows.	
Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?	1
Serestia	
Serestia was watching penguins play soccer and suddenly decided to raise a pet penguin herself. Let's talk to her.	
Oh, that'll be so cute!	
It would be good to have one of each color, and when they're all grown up... Make 'em into a good meal!	
We can play soccer with the penguins!	-1
Serestia	
You're walking in a narrow ally and come across Serestia having an intense staring contest with the captain of the opposing team. What should we say?	
Save the energy for the match.	-1
How about solving this with a game of rock, scissors, paper?	
...I see two idiots standing in front of me...	
Serestia	
During a match, Serestia bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. She seems depressed. What should we say to cheer her up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep on going. 	3
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself. 	
Serestia	
The team will not have a match for some time. Serestia asks you about your plan.	
We could ask one of the top teams for a friendly match.	1
Hmm, wanna go shopping?	
I have a very hard training session all planned up for everybody.	
Serestia	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Serestia is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.	1
He's obviously obsessed with soccer.	
This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.	3
Serestia	
Serestia lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good... Can anybody give her some heals.	
Well, this could have been prevented if you just consumes those Swirlies like I told you...	
I will avenge you!	-1
Serestia	
Serestia is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with her.	
Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.	1
Well, having a good ace skill is a start.	
Flawless skills.	3
Serestia	
The team is having a good run and Serestia is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.	
Let's keep this momentum going!	
As long as we're not used as training material...	
There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.	3
Serestia	
It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Serestia and talk about what to do.	
We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.	-1
I hope they have a "Continue" button around here.	
Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.	
Serestia	
Serestia is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.	
It's surprising to see such advanced technology.	
Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.	1
Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.	
Serestia	
The crowd is cheering for Serestia. Serestia seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.	
They're all in love with your enthusiastic play.	
They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.	-1
How about just accepting the compliments for today?	
	
Shura	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	3
Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.	1
Let's give them a hand.	
Shura	
Latios is chatting with Shura after the match. Let's barge in.	
Don't you think about sneaking her out. She's out pretty girl.	3
Shura was fantastic on the field, right?	
I'm looking forward to our next match!	
Shura	
Shura looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.	
It's space. Anything can exist here.	-1
How about we ask Jeunese?	3
Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.	1
Shura	
The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Shura to set some simple rules.	
This team is a mess. Gather everybody on the field. I'll knock that spirit back into you guys if I have to.	-1
Let's split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.	1
Come on, I'll show you the best spots around!	3
Shura	
You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Shura seems to be worried.	
Weakling. Should've been rougher on that player.	
It's unfortunate, but that's something that happens during a match and it's not our fault.	
Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.	3
Shura	
You come across Shura being lost and wandering around while going back to the lodging. Let's talk to her.	
Are you feeling alright?	
Don't use that ability on the field...	
Don't worry, I'll go with you.	1
Shura	
Shura is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.	
I'm afraid to be honest.	
I was always looking forward for that moment.	-1
Stay by my side and make sure i don't make any mistakes, will you?	3
Shura	
Shura is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?	
We'll find the ones that did this and use them as fertilizers.	
It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.	
Who could've done such a hideous thing?	3
Shura	
Mimi continues to praise Princess Meiran and it's likely that this isn't going to end any time soon. Shura seems to be sick of this.	
Okay! Now I'll tell you all the good stuff about Shura!	3
Iron Claw!	-1
Oh, there's Princess Meiran! (Runs away)	
Shura	
It seems that Shura is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?	
Listen carefully and you'll find her.	3
Let's ask Khirel to find her...	
Shura? Nha,she never gets lost.	
Shura	
Shura came back without a penny after marching into the Casino.	
What happened to you? Do you want me to lend you some money?	3
I'm sure you got scammed.	1
I hope that wasn't all you got.	-1
Shura	
Shura, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.	
It was an intense feeling as if I was going against the strongest team in the universe.	
I've never dreamt about soccer.	
I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.	3
Shura	
The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Shura do?	
(Give her instructions so that she can do her share of the cleaning quickly.)	1
(Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)	-1
(Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.)	3
Shura	
You find Shura depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.	
Don't mind it. It's our fault. We weren't able to make use of your strength.	
You did well and I thank you for that.	1
It's not your fault that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!	3
Shura	
Shura announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.	
You'll have to compete with me!	3
I feel bad for the players that have to face you.	1
I have faith in you.	1
Shura	
You find Shura lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?	
Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?	
Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!	3
Hmm, I guess you're more domestic than I thought.	
Shura	
Shura is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?	
You can overcome this like always. Right?	
It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.	3
Let's solve the problems one by one.	
Shura	
Shura is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to her?	
That doesn't change what we must do.	
Come on, cheer up.  You're not being yourself.	3
Stop whining. I like it better when you're arrogant and sarcastic.	
Shura	
Shura seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.	
It's thanks to you! Thanks for listening to me instructions!	
I'm starting to see the true stregth in this team.	
Perfect! No mistakes made!	3
Shura	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	1
Stop right there, pig!	3
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	
Shura	
Shura is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.	
I'll sleep by your side tonight.	3
I see. We must be careful. I'll be watching over you.	
It's just a dream. Forget about it.	1
Shura	
The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Shura and her opponent isn't over yet.	
You better win that fight!	-1
Hey! The match is over!	3
I've never seen her worked up that much.	
Shura	
Shura caught a player on the other team spying on your team's practice. What should we do?	
I think we should hang him.	-1
Why don't we take this opportunity to see how our opponents are practicing.	1
You came to see my marvelous moves? I'm flattered.	3
Shura	
A teammate is being stubborn about going out on the field while having a very severe fever. What should we do?	
I'll tackle him down! Knock his lights out!	3
Don't kill him, okay?	-1
We're taking him to the doctor even if that means by force. Help me.	1
Shura	
You come across Shura who is limping. She says it's nothing. What should we do?	
I think I'll get injured too if you're on the field. Please sit on the bench.	3
Trust me and your teammates. Sit this one out.	1
Don't push yourself too hard. Get off the field if you don't think you can continue.	-1
Shura	
Shura's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Shura seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.	
That player is just messing with you.	1
I think that player likes you.	3
You're doing fine. Don't play your opponent's game.	
Shura	
You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.	
Can't you cook ramen by yourself?	
Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.	3
Is Marilyn your mother or nanny?	
Shura	
Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Shura.	
I think he felt better because of the positive energy you always have around you.	1
Maybe he got embarassed for being obsessed with his past?	-1
You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.	3
Shura	
The opponent team is spreading rumors that they lost because your team played dirty. What should we do?	
Well, you did get ''dirty'' by falling in the dirt.	3
We didn't play dirty, right?	1
They will never learn with an attitude like that.	1
Shura	
A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Shura. What should you say?	
Well, Shura does have that kind of charm.	1
Well, you're as cute as Shura.	3
I hope you two become good rivals.	
Shura	
Shura is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?	
Don't worry about me! Do your job!	
Can you peel this guy off of me?	-1
Don't come over here! It's dangerous!	3
Shura	
Shura says she doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. She thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.	
I think you two have something in common...	-1
Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.	1
Hmm? That is odd...What do you think about this?	3
Shura	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Shura some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	
Make him know who he's up against.	1
Let's try out some forward passes.	1
Shura	
Shura is questioning your promise to make the best team ever. It's time to redeem yourself.	
Don't be all negative because there were some mistakes.  You're a precious part of this team.	3
Don't be anxious.  Have faith and keep following me.	
That's why I need your help.	
Shura	
Shura looks nervous because the team will be moving to the planet where the next match will be held by taking a space shuttle without the help of Littre.	
Did you prepare your meds in case you get space-sick? Never mind, I'll prepare the meds.	3
Don't worry. Leave it up to me.	1
Littre will be fine.	
Shura	
You're watching the storm with Shura and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.	
Is something troubling her? I'm having a bad feeling.	
What's wrong with her?	
She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!	3
Shura	
Shura wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?	
That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.	-1
What about just watching?	
Sure. Let's beat them all and take the prize money!	
Shura	
Shura is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.	
We need a decent level of personal performance.	-1
What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?	3
Wreck the other team.	
Shura	
James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.	
...We should get out of here.	-1
...It's about to go down...! Where's the popcorn?	
James and Bora...Who's the villain?	-1
Shura	
Shura wants to cherish every precious meeting with other people and beings. She wants to be good friends with everybody. Let's talk to her.	
I'm surprised you care so much for your friends.	
Nothing is eternal, but that doesn't make it insignificant.	-1
It'll be pretty exciting if we could stay the same even after 10 years.	
	
Patricia	
Patricia says she was cornered by the team which was devastated by the loss streak.	
Tell them they should remember that they play for you.	
Just hear them out and smile. They'll feel better.	3
You can point out their mistakes and flaws but still keep things humorous. Just don't go too sarcastic on them.	
Patricia	
You're sick and in bed when Patricia and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?	
You guys...I'm about to cry...	1
I'm sorry...I should be giving you guys some tea or something, but...	
Get closer so I can spread my germs!	
Patricia	
Patricia is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.	
It's only a sport!  The strongest team wins, and we are strong!	1
I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.	
Aren't you the one everybody sould be afraid of?	
Patricia	
Patricia wants to know what the Swirlies really are. Give her an answer.	
Beginner level monsters in an RPG game.	-1
Thankful beings that will be our +160	-1
I'm planning to make a whole line of merchandise with them as the character.	3
Patricia	
Patricia says she's going to meet up with Kiki and asks if you have any questions.	
Is her name really Kiki?	
Ask her if she likes you and if she wants to join our team.	1
Tell her to be our lap cat.	
Patricia	
Patricia is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.	
Do you think they'll be tasty?	
I think they're cute and elegant if you leave out the pig and bear.	
I'd like to keep one as a pet.	3
Patricia	
Patricia says she's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give her an answer.	
They're young but they have passion.	1
Yeah, I mean they could get hurt.	
Teach them bow adults play soccer.	
Patricia	
Patricia is training hard to become scouted like the players that moved to teams that offered better conditions. Let's give her some advice.	
I hope you get scouted by an interseting team.	1
Make the souters fall in love with your performance!	
Let's make that our goal and make it happen,	3
	
Vitos	
During a match, Vitos bumped into a teammate and knocked the player out. He seems depressed. What should we say to cheer him up?	
Wasn't that a glitch?	
We have to keep on going. 	
It's something that happened during the match. Don't be so hard on yourself. 	3
Vitos	
It seems that Vitos is lost in the Nadir forest. What should we do?	
Listen carefully and you'll find him.	
Let's ask Khirel for her...	
Vitos? Nah, he never gets lost.	3
Vitos	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	3
Stop right there, pig!	-1
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	
Vitos	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Vitos is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.	3
He's obviously obsessed with soccer.	-1
This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.	
Vitos	
James is fighting Akane after ambushing Yuri, and Bora is slowly making her approach from a distance.	
...We should get out of here.	
...It's about to go down...! Where's the popcorn?	-1
James and Bora...Who's the villain?	
Vitos	
Vitos is depressed thinking that winning the Galaxy League is a goal that can't be achieved. What should we say to him?	
That doesn't change what we must do.	
Come on, cheer up. You're not being yourself.	1
Stop whining. I like it better when you're arrogant and sarcastic.	-1
Vitos	
Vitos announces that he will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give him an answer.	
You'll have to compete with me!	
I feel bad for the players that have to face you.	-1
I have faith in you.	
Vitos	
You come across an opponent player limping, because of getting injured during a match against your team. Vitos seems to be worried.	
Weakling. Should've been rougher on that player.	
It's unfortunate, but that's something that happened during a match and it's not our fault.	3
Let's just go. That player will also feel uncomfortable if we keep standing here.	
Vitos	
Vitos seems to be very confused of how a small soccer ball can change the fate of the universe.	
The fate of the universe is not that simple to be changed by a soccer ball.	1
Let's open up a bright future with this ball.	
Look out! (Kicks the ball far away)	
Vitos	
The team is having a good run and Vitos is sure that winning the League is a matter of time.	
Let's keep this momentum going.	
As long as we're not used as training material...	
There's still a lot of obstacles ahead.	1
Vitos	
Vitos looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.	
It's space. Anything can exist here.	3
How about we ask Jeunese?	1
Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.	
Vitos	
Vitos's form has been improving rapidly. He says he can't wait for the next match. What should we say to him?	
If you keep it up like that, you'd be able to play superbly in any position.	1
Remember that feeling and use it when things get tough.	
Consumed a lot of Swirlies, I see.	
Vitos	
Vitos is asking what the conditions of a team ace are with a serious face. Let's talk with him.	
Just act like yourself. You're already the ace.	3
Well, having a good ace skill is a start.	
Flawless skills.	
Vitos	
Vitos says he doesn't understand why other angels are afraid of Uriel. He thinks Uriel is a very kind angel.	
I think you have something in common.	
Maybe that's just because she's the leader of that group.	3
Hmm?  That is odd..... What do you think about this?	
Vitos	
Vitos is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?	
I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.	
All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.	1
I can tell that he's a very dilligent person that always tries his best.	
Vitos	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Vitos some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	-1
Make him know who he's up against.	-1
Let's try out some forward passes.	
Vitos	
Vitos suddenly laughs in joy during the match against the Empire. Why?	
The emperor of demons is also enjoying this match!	3
Has he gone mad?	
I guess he's happy this is a good match.	
Vitos	
Vitos is curious of the whereabouts of the managers that are nowhere to be seen during the match. Let's give him an answer.	
They're pn cooldown.	
They support us from the shadows.	1
Even if they're not on the field with us, we're fighting as one. Right?	
	
Malcolm	
Malcolm says that the captain of team Scout Entry seems to take good care of the team members.	
Well, I'm better than him because I'm in love with this team.	3
That's strange. I thought he was more of an authoritative character.	
Yeah, they get along pretty well.	
Malcolm	
The next opponent is the Lab Rat Entry. You hear that all of the players on the other team are victims of experiments and this makes you feel uncomfortable.	
That's a sad story. I'm tearing up.	1
I feel bad for them, but that's no excuse for throwing the game.	1
It would be rude to them if we don't do our best.	3
Malcolm	
Malcolm is surrounded by fans and seems to be overwhelmed. Let's talk to him.	
I hope this won't affect your performance on the field.	1
The fans love your performance!	3
Should've practiced that autograph like I told you.	
Malcolm	
Malcolm asks you about your plans after winning the Galaxy League. Let's give him a sincere answer.	
I guess I'll be chasing you on the road of glory.	1
I want to see everybody smile. I think that'll make me happy.	
I'm going to make a joke before I start crying!	3
Malcolm	
Malcolm has shown outstanding performance on both the offensive and defensive side. He is asking for your evaluation on his plays. Let's give him an answer.	
You always seem to find the weak point of the opponent's defense and I love that.	
Your attacks are so strong the opponents can't handle it. You should keep that going.	3
I hope you'd stop sharing small talks with your opponents on the field.	
Malcolm	
Malcolm is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to him.	
Life is a light of its own.	
That's deep. I think it's cool.	
How about we make it to the top of the Galaxy League and shine the universe with the light within us?	1
Malcolm	
Malcolm suggests that we have a team dinner to lighten things up. What will be your reaction?	
How about we go eat salad? I'm on a diet.	
How could you think about eating at a time like this? I'm disappointed in you.	
Good idea. Let's go eat some meat!	3
Malcolm	
Malcolm says he's the center of the team and asks if you agree with him. How should we answer?	
Of course! Everybody is counting on you!	-1
Well, your sarcastic jokes are an essential part of the team's strength.	
I'm sure that you're being a good influence to the team.	
Malcolm	
Malcolm seems very nervous to confront Kei of the Rescuer.	
Be careful not to be stomped on...	
We can do this! Let's go!	1
Don't be nervous! Don't you trust your teammates?	3
Malcolm	
Malcolm brought a drink that she says received from the coach on the other team. It looks very suspicious especially with the dark fumes coming out of it.	
The drink looks really scary... But we can't just throw it away...	
Throw it away. NOW.	-1
Drink it up!	
Malcolm	
Malcolm is getting suspicious about how all the Gate Keepers are in the form of different animals.	
Do you think they'll be tasty?	3
I think they're cute and elegant if you leave out the pig and bear.	
I'd like to keep one as a pet.	
Malcolm	
Malcolm seems to get along with the opponent player. What should we tell him?	
Congratulations! How did you guys get along?	
Don't forget we exist! Haha!	
Good for you! I know it's hard for you to find someone at your level!	1
	
Valkia	
Valkia is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to her.	
It's only a sport!  The strongest team wins, and we are strong!	
I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.	3
Aren't you the one everybody sould be afraid of?	
	
Lilith	
Lilith is deeply focused on Jill's diet story. What should we do?	
I don't think you need to worry about diets.	1
You're playing soccer! You're fine!	1
Please don't forget about the match.	
Lilith	
Lilith is having a delightful chat with a girl that's holding a turtle.	
You seem like the princess...Scratch that, the queen.	-1
She seems like a nice girl.	
It's nice to see two people of different class have a delightful chat.	
Lilith	
Lilith is worried about Vermilion Bird. She thinks something is troubling Vermilion Bird.	
Maybe this is something about love and hate. It may be something serious.	-1
Didn't she grow up being friends with the princess?i think i know what's going on...	
Maybe being the heir of an honorable family has its burdens.	
Lilith	
Being too excited, Lilith is overreacting while talking about the game. It seems she wants people to agree with her.	
I've never seen you so excited! You did a great job out there!	1
You're excited only because you got the chance to shoot the ball without any restraints against that player you like.	-1
Yeah. The sight of you running on the field was marvelous.	
	
Black Daisy	
Black Daisy wants to hear about your plans on training the new players. What should we answer?	
Perfect planning and perfect execution.	1
All goes as planned... Hmm? Just ignore that.	
Why don't you join them and find out?	
Black Daisy	
You were enjoying the peaceful day on Earth until the Peacemakers suddenly showed up. At that moment, the Magical Girl Elements came to save the day!	
Cool! Awesome!	3
Oh, come on! Where's the transformation scene?!	
...Uh...So no soccer?	
Black Daisy	
Black Daisy is suddenly taking interest in who Shootmeister actually is. What should we say?	
I heard he's a super agent from Nebrion.	
All that I care is that he's an excellent trainer.	1
I can tell that he's a very diligent person that always tries his best.	
Black Daisy	
It's a hard match and your team is losing. Talk with Black Daisy and talk about what to do.	
We can't give up here. There's still a chance to win this.	-1
I hope they have a "Continue" button around here.	
Let's come up with a plan after this match is over.	
Black Daisy	
This match will be held on Earth. We still have some time. What do you want to do?	
Well, I could show you around and introduce you to the things on Earth.	3
I heard that the bath products on Earth are the best in the universe.	
I'm going to check out the new comic issues. Wanna come along?	
Black Daisy	
Black Daisy is complaining about restricted from playing the next match for receiving too many fouls. Let's talk to her.	
It's the consequences of your actions. Accept it.	
I feel sorry for you and envy you at the same time.	3
Use this as a chance to enhance your condition.	
Black Daisy	
Your team is playing against the Scout Entries and Malcolm seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. Black Daisy is starting to get intimidated.	
Okay, it's time we take this match seriously.	
He's obviously obsessed with soccer.	
This is good. We can use this as a chance to break their back line.	1
Black Daisy	
Black Daisy thinks Nana on the other team actually isn't a raccoon.	
That's because you haven't opened up your "third eye"!	
Isn't that the same with all other beastmen?	
Hmm,her tail is a bit weird and her ears are definitely human...	1
Black Daisy	
Black Daisy is surprised of how sturdy the ball is, as it withstands the strength of angels, demons, and even beings of unknown worlds.	
It's surprising to see such advanced technology.	
Well, I have no problem with it as long as it functions as a soccer ball.	-1
Do you think we can sell it? I think we could get a good price.	
Black Daisy	
With a serious face, Black Daisy is asking what the true meaning of competition is. Let's give her an answer.	
Being together is enough for me.	-1
Away that a mere high school student can prevent the universe from falling into chaos?	
Well,l'm sure we'll get an answer when we get to the end of this.	
Black Daisy	
Black Daisy is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.	
This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!	
Gate keeper dolls! Why not!	3
How about some presents for your parents?	
Black Daisy	
Black Daisy says that the Swirlies are missing.	
They were sacrificed as material for a greater cause.	
They have wings so I'm sure they flew away.	3
I evolved them.	
Verister	
The team became furious after seeing Verister fall by the focused attack of the opposing team and used that fury to win the game. Let's say something.	
You did well. Don't worry!	1
You can rely on your teammates in situations like this.	1
Your beauty is a curse.	3
Verister	
Verister is worried about Vermilion Bird. She thinks something is troubling Vermilion Bird.	
Maybe this is something about love and hate. It may be something serious.	
Didn't she grow up being friends with the princess? I think I know what's going on...	3
Maybe being the heir of an honorable family has its burdens.	
Verister	
Verister is confused that she won the MVP. What should you tell him?	
Nice'y done! We're throwing a party today!	3
You deserve it. Well done!	
Aren't you satisfied with your performance?	
Verister	
The team is saying bad things about Verister for skipping practice. Time to intervene.	
Do you really think that she would skip practice?	
Skipping practice isn't something that's in her dictionary.	
Her love towards soccer is real.	3
Verister	
A defender on the other team seems to have fallen in love with Verister and is chasing her around the field. It looks like the player forgot about the match. What should we do?	
Nobody can resist that charm of yours.	3
Come to me! I'll take care of it!	
That's like playing with fire.	
Verister	
Verister is asking what it would be like to date an alien. Give her your opinion.	
I believe it'll be romantic.	3
I guess the platonic side would be important.	
I believe there was an old movie about an alien infiltrating a spaceship...	
Verister	
Verister is asking about my ideal type of person. Should be careful about answering this...	
I have very specific standards for personality, looks, values, and background. Are you interested in hearing about it?	
I'm all about the feeling. A spark is all it takes.	
I think that being able to understand each other is the most important.	1
Verister	
Verister is making a scene. She'd rather jump into space than to be eaten alive by vicious aliens.	
Vicious? More like ugly.	
The door's over there.	
Are you giving up before putting up a fight?	1
Verister	
Verister is all alone in the locker room worrying about the fate of the universe. Let's go talk to her.	
It's silly of you to worry about such things.  Are you feeling okay?	3
We must have faith in the Gate Keepers and win the Galaxy League.	
A mysterious villian...Bad taste, if you ask me.	
Verister	
Verister seems to be worried about one of the team members that left after a quarrel. Let's talk to her.	
Everybody should grow up.	
It'll be alright. Don't worry.	
Let's go look for him.	1
Verister	
It seems that Verister is wondering what to do after a teammate proposed to her. It doesn't seem that she's not entirely uninterested. What should we do?	
Just make sure that it doesn't affect him on the field.	3
Why don't you start with trading diaries?	-1
It's not you to be kind to everybody. Just go and say no.	
Verister	
It's before the 2nd half, and Verister is complaining that we're up against an opponent that's too strong.	
We should at least put up a fight so they remember us.	
There's nothing we can really do. let's just get this over with.	
Don't give up until the end.	1
Verister	
Verister is asking about the whereabouts of a teammate that hasn't seen for quite a while. Let's give her an answer.	
You said you want to be with him...So I used him as material for your special training.	-1
I used him as training material so that he could be useful to you.	
I sold him. We were in need of gold.	
Verister	
Verister is criticizing the male teammates that were mesmerized by Lilith during the match. It's your job to defend your teammates.	
This could all be avoided if we become mesmerized by you. Do as you please.	-1
I think they're also mesmerized by you. You have a charm that matches a demon...	
As pathetic as they are, let's let this one slide.	
Verister	
Does one have to make intentional fouls in order to win? Let's give her some advice.	
is winning really worth going that far?	
I don't see anything wrong as long as you can get away with it.	
Be true to yourself.	1
Verister	
Verister asks what you think is the most important ability in soccer. Give her an answer.	
Excitement and elegance. the fans love it.	
Fair spirit and sportsmanship.	
Getting to know your opponents up to the point of falling in love with them... And then crushing them.	-1
Verister	
Verister is having trouble finding a Spirit Stone that fits her needs and taste. Let's give her advice.	
How about Metatron's Will? It's cute wth the butterfly decorations.	3
I recommend the pure Paradise of Light.	
What about Silent Cold? You'll be able to hold onto your opponents.	
Zibroi	
Zibroi says he's having trouble dealing with the young players. Let's give him an answer.	
They're young but they have passion.	1
Yeah, I mean they could get hurt.	
Teach them how adults play soccer.	
Zibroi	
The team is in a slump and you take the team out for refreshment. Talk with Zibroi to set some simple rules.	
This team is a mess. Gather everybody on the field. Ill knock that spirit back into you guys if i have to	
Lets split up and meet back here for dinner. Tell everybody to enjoy their free time.	
come on, ill show you the best spots around!	3
Zibroi	
You find Zibroi lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?	
Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?	
Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!	
Hmm, I guess you're more domestic than I thought.	1
Zibroi	
Zibroi looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.	
It's space. Anything can exists here.	
How about we ask Jeunese?	3
Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.	
Zibroi	
Zibroi is saying that the universe needs more than stars to brighten it up. Let's talk to him.	
Life is a light of its own.	
That's deep. I think it's cool.	3
How about we make it to the top of the Galaxy League and shine the universe with the light within us?	
Zibroi	
Kei and Virgil are fighting again and Zibroi seems to be troubled. What should we do?	
If you guys keep giving Zibroi trouble, I swear to god I'll use you both as special training material.	1
If you had to choose one of the two, which would it be?	
You both need to be disciplined by Zibroi.	
	
Nebra	
Still looking pretty heated up by the match, Nebra is asking how he did in the match.	
You were picking the other team apart! It was awesome!	3
It was pretty scary watching you so pleased with the rough plays of the opponents.	
You bring the best out of the team. Good work!	
Nebra	
It's dinner time and Nebra is staring at his carrot soup with a troubled look. What should we do?	
(Eat it instead of him.)	
(Tell her to put the carrots in the soup on Hildegard's plate.)	-1
(Tell her that carrots are good for the body and to eat it all.)	
Nebra	
Nebra says that he thinks Alkyde looks at Fontus in a funny way. Let's give him an answer.	
That's a mixture of mockery, sympathy, love.	-1
I think she likes him.	
Maybe she's up to something.	
Nebra	
Nebra did his best, but he failed to achieve the results he wanted and looks sad. We should say something to him.	
Sorry, I feel this is on me.	3
That wasn't enough! You have to try harder!	
It's experiences like this that bonds us together.	
Niarose	
Niarose seems to be lost after having a good match while her fortune-telling said things would go wrong. Let's talk to her.	
They say the fortune-telling is inaccurate if you don't pay a sufficient price.	-1
It's just a myth. Forget about it.	
Game results aren't that simple to be predicted by fortune telling.	
Niarose	
Niarose is stressed out saying her opponent has the upper ground on every aspect. What should we do?	
You can overcome this like always. Right?	
It's not your fault. It's your mistakes that took the opponents off guard.	-1
Let's solve the problems one by one.	
Niarose	
You're at the Yggdrasil memorial ceremony. The Yggdrasil Guardians are parading through the festive crowd.	
If this is how they do a memorial in Valhalla, it's natural to understand and accept.	
I think it's a nice way to cherish the memories of the lost.	1
Maybe it was a good thing? I mean they say it's a tragedy, but look at how joyful it is.	
Niarose	
You find Niarose depressed for not playing well during the match. Let's cheer her up.	
Don't mind it. It's our fault. We weren't able to make use of your strength.	
You did well and thank you for that.	3
It's not your fault that you fell during the match. Don't worry about it!	
Orses	
You find Orses lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?	
Hello! Have you come back to buy food for dinner?	1
Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!	
Hmm, i guess you're more domestic than I thought.	
Orses	
This was the worst game in your entire life...Orses comes to you to cheer you up.	
Please explain why you kicked the ball into our goal post, will you?	-1
Thanks...I know you're the one that's the most devastated...Let's do better next time.	
Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my fee.	
Orses	
Orses, who is determined to make everything in her life, even her dreams, about soccer, asks you what it's like to dream about soccer. Let's think about it.	
It was an intense feeling as if I was going against the strongest team in the universe.	
I've never dreamt about soccer.	1
I've been chased by a soccer ball monster in my dreams. It was terrifying.	
Orses	
The team manger ran away with all of the team's money. What should we do?	
We could start a reset marathon.	
We're going to hunt that manager down and take back our money. We will show no mercy!	3
Let's ask for help to the League officials on this planet.	
Orses	
Orses suggests that we visit the Celestial Castle, which is a place that the baby angels live.	
What's the agenda here? Are you trying to taint the pure angels?	
This is a good chance to show the baby angels how rough soccer can be!	3
That would be wonderful! I'll go ask for permission.	
Orses	
Orses wants the team to enter the Underground League on Earth. What should we do?	
That seems like a dangerous idea...Let's not make any quick decisions.	
What about just watching?	
Sure. Let's beat them all and take the prize money!	3
Orses	
You're sick and in bed when Orses and the teammates come to cheer you up. What will your response be?	
You guys...I'm about to cry...	
I'm sorry...I should be giving you guys some tea or something but...	1
Get closer so I can spread my germs!	
Orses	
Orses wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.	
Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.	
The character story left him a trauma.	1
Maybe he just wants to duke it out.	
Orses	
Orses is looking excited and asks how the match went.	
The other team went home crying!	3
They were a worthy opponent.	
I led our team to victory with wedgies!	
Orses	
Orses is asking about what's the most important condition in winning today's match. Let's give her an answer.	
We need a decent level of personal performance.	1
What could it be? Money? Luck? Weather? Hmm? What?	
Wreck the other team.	
Orses	
Orses announces that she will become an influential player that changes the league completely. Let's give her an answer.	
You'll have to compete with me!	
I feel bad for the players that have to face you.	3
I have faith in you.	
	
Wizol	
Wizol is blaming the team for their pass mistakes and is questioning their soccer skills.	
This needs to be analyzed and fixed. Can you help me?	
Passes that you prefer aren't always the right answer.	-1
It can't be perfect every time.	
Wizol	
On a day off, Wizol is looking at a passing couple with jealous eyes.	
I'd love to have a stable job first.	
It's really hard to find the right person.	
If you find a beautiful woman, try talking to her!	3
	
Ami	
The crowd is cheering for Ami. Ami seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help her out.	
They're all in love with your enthusiastic play.	
They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.	3
How about just accepting the compliments for today?	
Ami	
A player on the other side is on the field with his arms tied up. Let's talk about this with Ami.	
I feel like he's mocking us!	
It hurts when the whip first crackles. And the pain just keeps ramping up.	3
He still has his two legs functioning. I see no problem with that.	
Ami	
You're watching the storm with Ami and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.	
Is something troubling her? I'm having a bad feeling.	
What's wrong with her?	3
She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!	
Ami	
Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Ami.	
I think he felt better because of the positive energy you always have around you.	
Maybe he got embarassed for being obsessed with his past?	3
You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.	
Ami	
Ami lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good... Can anybody give her some heals?	
Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...	
I will avenge you!	1
Ami	
A player on the other team says soccer became enjoyable after confronting Ami. What should you say?	
Well, Ami does have that kind of charm.	
Well, you're as cute as Ami.	
I hope you two become good rivals.	-1
	
Lynbell	
Lynbell is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.	
Yeah, i understand you.Soccer is so much fun!	-1
Life,eh? I guess that's a bit too serious for me,but I think I understand how you feei.	
And that's how we walk towards our destiny.	
Lynbell	
Lynbell's opponent is smiling whenever they confront each other on the field. Lynbell seems to be nervous. Let's talk to her.	
That player is just messing with you.	
I think that player likes you.	-1
You're doing fine. Don't play your opponent's game.	
Lynbell	
Lynbell is having trouble with continuing nightmares. Let's talk to her.	
I'll sleep by your side tonight.	1
I see. We must be careful. Ill be watching over you.	
It's just dream. Forget about it.	
Lynbell	
The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Lynbell and her opponent isn't over yet.	
You better win that fight!	1
Hey! the match is over!	
I've never seen her worked up that much.	
Lynbell	
Lynbell is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.	
This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!	
Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!	1
How about some presents for your parents?	
Lynbell	
Lynbell seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.	
It's thanks to you! Thanks for listening to my instructions!	3
I'm starting to see ture strength in this team.	
Perfect! No mistakes made!	
Lynbell	
You're watching the storm with Lynbell and you spot Princess Meiran taking a walk while humming.	
Is somethis troubling her? I'm haveing a bad feeling.	3(?)
What's wrong with her?	
She shines even in the darkest storms! How gorgeous!	3(?)
Lynbell	
Lynbell is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.	
Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!	
You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.	1
I knew this day would come.	
Lynbell	
Lynbell is curious about the Galaxy League. What answer will help her?	
It's the place where then chosen ones learn about their destiny.	3
It's the place of dreams colliding.	1
It's stressful because we can't prepare for extraterrestrial sanitation. We're completely exposed to all those unknown...things.	
	
Lindberg	
Lindberg is asking about your thoughts on meeting an extraterrestrial being. Let's give her an answer.	
I'm affraid to be honest.	
I was always looking forward fot that moment. 	3
Stay by my side and make sure I don't make any mistakes, will you?	1
Lindberg	
Lindberg is asking who you think of first when you win a match. Let's answer.	
My teammates and their flawless play!	1
My friends from previous life...They would be pleased to see me win.	
My fans!	
Lindberg	
Lindberg is asking what to buy in the souvenir shop. Let's give her an opinion.	
This is your chance to buy the hottest fashion items in space!	1
Gate Keeper dolls! Why not!	
How about some presents for your parents?	1
Lindberg	
Baltheon, who was upset when he was asked about his past, suddenly started to feel better when he saw Lindberg.	
I think he felt better because of the positive energy you always have around you.	1
Maybe he got embarassed for being obsessed with his past?	
You saved us all from that awkward moment by tripping on your own foot.	
Lindberg	
Lindberg is suddenly showing massive improvement in her performance. She must've learned something during a match.	
Impressive! You're the ace of this team now!	3
You've become better. Now you need to focus on staying that way.	
I knew this day would come.	-1
Lindberg	
Lindberg is worried about the team's poor performance. Let's go talk to her.	
Everybody is not at 100%. But, I think we'll do better sooner or later.	3
It's all because nobody on this team cares about strategy! This is nonsense!	-1
We haven't awakened our TRUE powers! We have to go further beyong!	
Lindberg	
Lindberg is being sentimental about how soccer, which was supposed to be a one time thing, became her life. Let's talk with her.	
Yeah, I understand you. Soccer is so much fun!	3
Life, eh? I guess that's a bit too serious for me, but I think I understand how you feel.	
And that's how we walk towards our destingy	
Lindberg	
Lindberg says that Hiro, a member of the Einherjar, doesn't remember why he was revived.	
Hmm, a revived person that forgets his purpose...Reminds me of somebody.	
He'll remember someday.	3
That's bad. I'm sure it's something important.	
Lindberg	
The team will be cleaning up the lodging. What will you have Lindberg do?	
(Give her instructions so that she can do her share of the cleaning quickly.)	-1
(Let her take some of the team members and allow them to clean freely.)	3
(Let her clean, but warn her not to cause any trouble.)	
Lindberg	
Lindberg is angry about the opponent's resilient attack on you. What should we say?	
don't worry about me! Do your job!	1
Can you peel this guy off me?	3
Don't come over here! It's dangerous!	
Lindberg	
Sorrow suddenly flies off after seeing a shiny object in the sky.	
Well, now what?	
Come back Huginn! Wait, is it Muninn?	
A crow?!	3
Lindberg	
You witness Fontus, the most violent and powerful creature in the universe, flying the night sky in a Santa costume.	
...The stress has finally got to him. It must be that...	3
Ugh...I want to dig my eyes out.	
Fontus...You sure are my archnemesis!	
Lindberg	
The game ended as a tie, but it seems that the competition between Lindberg and her opponent isn't over yet.	
You better win that fight.	3
Hey! The match is over!	
I've never seen her worked up before.	
Lindberg	
Lindberg seems to be satisfied with the perfect team work. Let's talk to her.	
It's thanks to you! Thanks for listening to me instructions!	1
I'm starting to see the true stregth in this team.	
Perfect! No mistakes made!	
Lindberg	
You visit Marilyn's house and see Hildegard eating ramen.	
Can't you cook ramen by yourself?	
Ramen, that's a dangerous food to cook.	
Is Marilyn your mother or nanny?	1
Lindberg	
The members of Siena Celtron are furiously searching the stadium for Kuma.	
Kuma alert! Get back to the shelter!	-1
Let's ignore them and get ready for the match.	
Let's give them a hand.	3
	
Ronald	
Ronald is impressed by the help he received from the elementals. Let's talk to him.	
The only problem is that they take up a lot of space in the inventory	-1
I feel like the whole universe is cheering for us when we're with the elementals!	3
I am so thankful to them.	
Ronald	
Ronald is worried about all of the powerful beings that will be competing in the Galaxy League. Let's say something to him.	
It's only a sport! The strongest team wins, and we are strong!	
I'm sure everybody is feeling the same way you feel.	
Aren't you the one everybody should be afraid of?	1
Ronald	
This was the worst game in your entire life...Ronald comes to you to cheer you up.	
Please explain why you kicked the ball into our goal post, will you?	
Thanks...I know you're the one that's the most devastated...Let's do better next time.	3
Thanks. You always know how to get me back on my fee.	
Ronald	
You were taking a walk in the Nadir forest with Ronald and came across Enthia standing in the middle of a burnt part of the forest.	
Let's give her some space.	
I could really use some grilled sweet potatoes and chestnuts.	
There's no time for tears! Find out who did this and bring justice.	3
Ronald	
With back to back matches, the team is exhausted. Let's talk to Ronald for solutions.	
We won't be able to win the league if we fail to overcome this.	
I guess it's time the benchwarmers get a chance	1
How about we put that advanced technology of Metro City to use 	
Ronald	
The crowd is cheering for Ronald. Ronald seems to find this situation new and a bit uncomfortable. Let's help him out.	
They're all in love with your enthusiastic play.	
They know you gave everything you got. It was spectacular.	3
How about just accepting the compliments for today?	
Ronald	
Ronald won a trip around the world from a radio event!	
What about soccer? You'll have to go through me to go on the trip!	
Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.	-1
...World? What about space? Isn't that more interesting?	
Ronald	
Ronald lost to the opponent and fell to the ground. What should we do?	
This doesn't look good... Can anybody give him some heals?	3
Well, this could all have been prevented if you just consumed those Swirlies like I told you...	
I will avenge you!	
Ronald	
As Ronald said, the universe is facing a new course of destiny because of the Galaxy League. Let's talk to him.	
I'm sure it's going in a good direction.	
I feel like the universe is heading towards chaos.	
It's not the Galaxy League. We are the ones that are leading the fate of this universe.	-1
	
Asakura	
Cracsus threatens to hack Asakura's personal information and reveal it to the world. What should we do?	
Let's blackmail Robin that we'll pluck out of his plants.	1
I contacted Hildegard.	
Don't fall for this cheap shot.	
Asakura	
You find Asakura lurking around the food corner at the shopping center. What should we say?	
Hello! Have you come here to buy food for dinner?	3
Stop wandering around the kids snack corner!	
Hmm, I guess you're more domestic than I thought.	
Asakura	
Asakura is thinking about what Selena said about saving the galaxy if we win the Galaxy League.	
Then we should do our very best to win.	
I can play along if there's something for me.	-1
It's not good to just believe what others say.	
Asakura	
Asakura is thinking about what the Universe of Oblivion is.	
Don't be scared about such petty things.	3
I don;t like the word oblivion.	
I don't care as long as it doesn't harm me.	-1
Asakura	
Asakura is sad that the World Tree in Umbra has withered. What could we say to cheer her up?	
We'll find the ones that did this and use them as fertilizers.	
It's a big tree. It'll stand strong.	3
Who could've done such a hideous thing?	1
Asakura	
Asakura, who is always suspicious of you, has you in the corner and is demanding that you reveal who you really are. What should we answer?	
To become the strongest being in space! I shall tramp on everything that stands in my path!	
Just playing soccer, that's all.	3
To bring justice with soccer. That's all.	-1
Asakura	
The middle fielder on the other team is too powerful. Let's give Asakura some orders.	
Pass? Shoot? Forfeit? Argh! Just make a run for it!	
Make him know who he's up against.	-1
Let's try out some forward passes.	
Asakura	
Asakura looks startled after learning the underworld actually exists.	
It's space. Anything can exist here.	3
How about we ask Jeunese?	
Sounds like a more boring place than Cruzentes.	
Asakura	
Something must have startled Beelzebub. He has entered the field and is making a scene.	
It's time we use him as training material.	3
Stop right there, pig!	
Team! We're having sauteed shredded pork for tonight!	
Asakura	
You're at the Underground to enter a wager match, but you find people who are playing a friendly match.	
How can I earn gold? Where do I have to go to find the REAL Underground?	
It's sort of an obligation for first class athletes like me to mingle with the community.	
So, there are no real illegal matches. I guess I'm relieved.	-1
Asakura	
The teammates are speaking highly of Asakura, saying she's a good role model. Let's add in.	
Thank you for doing whatever it takes to win.	
She shows dominance with elegance.	
She's truly a role model to us all with her skills and attitude.	-1
Asakura	
The representative of the refugees of Karladure is pleading you to throw the next match because Guinevere, who is providing them economic support, is playing for your next opponent. What should we say?	
A square match is what suites a proud royalty.	3
Would she be happy if she finds out you're doing this?	
That has nothing to do with us.	
Pinol	
Pinol wonders why Castor twitches whenever he sees Beatrice.	
Long ago, he was disgraceful towards a dragon emissary.	
The character story left him a trauma.	
Maybe he just wants to duke it out.	1
	
Rosette	
Rosette is furious about the referee that's clearly favoring the other team. Should we stop her?	
(Step on the referee's foot and pretend it was an accident.)	
The tougher it gets, the better it feels to win. Right?	
Ignore the referee. Focus on the match.	1
	
Marianne	
Marianne is thinking about what the Universe of Oblivion is.	
Don't be scared about such petty things.	
I don't like the word oblivion.	-1
I don't care as long as it doesn't harm me.	
Durahan	
Durahan won a trip around the world from a radio event!	
What about soccer? You'll have to go through me to go on the trip!	
Hmm, come back to me with a vacation plan.	
...World? What about space? Isn't that more interesting?	3
